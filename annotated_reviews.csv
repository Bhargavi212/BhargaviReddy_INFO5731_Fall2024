1,"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",positive
2,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",positive
3,"Positives: I loved the casting. Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DeNiro, and Lily Gladstone did a fantastic job in this film.Covers the book well, touching on most of the major highlights of it.Negatives:
I read the book and that was 1000% more intense, paced well, and left you hanging on every word. The movie revealed everything to us in chronological order in a very slow fashion, thereby eliminating all suspense and mystery.The movie was 1.5 hours too long. Martin could have cut down the movie and made it more concise by highlighting the greed of white man when they struck oil, how many of those men swindled Osage out of their fortunes, covered more of the introduction of J. Edgar Hoover and the birth of the FBI (all of his trials and tribulations, including mistakes made during this investigation), included some small but crucial moments like mentioning that Ernest was Mollie's guardian, bring up that Lizzie's death was suspected posioning, reduced some of the cinematic shots that Martin seems fixated on (you'll know when you see them), and I wish he introduced this movie from the perspective of the FBI.",neutral
4,"I never heard of Osage Nation before this. It was a 3 hour 26 minute education not just of the oil wealth and of American Indian culture but of sensitive filmmaking crafted so beautifully Michelangelo would have cried. Lily Gladstone has a classic, timeless, renaissance Madonna face and Robbie Robertson's tender score embellished her sensitive performance perfectly. True to Mr Scorsese's form, it ran so long and needed a deus ex machine ending that while innovative, brought (for me) the film to a premature end. Dessert was served too soon. Otherwise, I could not say a bad thing about this show. Mr Scorsese, I wish you a very long life so you can continue your master craft for mere mortals like me for a long time to come.",neutral
5,"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",negative
6,"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",negative
7,"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",positive
8,"First of all, I would like to address the reviews that state this film is about pushing ""liberal white guilt"". It is not, it is a true story with villains who were tried and convicted in the American court system after an investigation led by the conservative head of the FBI, J Edgar Hoover. I highly recommend that everyone reads the nonfiction book of the same title by David Grann prior to watching this film.I was fortunate to see an advanced screening of this film yesterday at the Zurich Film Festival. Martin Scorsese certainly satisfied the monumental challenge of bringing this story to the cinema. The actors fully possess their tragic and complicated characters, especially Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone (who I hope to see more of). The score, cinematography and featured songs only contributed further.Despite its length, the rather abrupt but appropriate conclusion left me feeling melancholic to depart this cinematic masterpiece and it has remained in my thoughts for hours since. Please go and watch this film and recommend it to others once you do.",positive
9,"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",positive
10,"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",positive
11,"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",positive
12,"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",positive
13,"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",positive
14,"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",positive
15,"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",negative
16,"As the title says, I believe this is one of the best movies we have seen in many years. To start out, the acting is just incredible with DiCaprio, Gladstone and De Niro all at the top of their game. I was very hyped for this movie and I wasn't not disappointed. Despite the 3hr 20m runtime, this movie goes by in an instant. You could watch it 3 times and it would only feel like you'd watched the original runtime. The score, the acting, the story, the cinematography, the writing, the directing, it's all absolutely masterful and incredible. I would one hundred percent recommend this movie to anyone.",neutral
17,"Martin Scorsese has produced a lot of all-time great films. Lately he's made overhyped and under-edited time wasters.The history of the willful execution of the Osage people to swindle their oil wealth is an important tale to tell. With incredible actors to tell the tale this should have been a masterpiece. It was with this in mind that I was extremely excited to watch this film.Instead Scorsese's inability to make proper cuts to his films (see The Irishman) makes an otherwise well told story a drag. Good moviemakers know how to compress good books to fit a two to two and a half hour window. He seems to have lost this ability and the result is too many redundant scenes that are repeating the same dialogue.This is especially the case with the constant manipulation between De Niro and DiCaprio, both of whom put in captivating performances even if they are inappropriately cast as characters that are supposed to be decades younger. Multiple scenes between the two could have been removed with only positive results.The ultimate conclusion to this film is predictably clear after about an hour, yet it takes well over two more hours to get there leaving much of the audience exhausted and disinterested by the end. This is such a disappointment and a disservice to this subject that I actually felt anger towards the director instead of the people who perpetrated such atrocities against the Osage people.",positive
18,"Killer of the Flower MoonThe film tells of the Osage Indians, who after finding oil in their land, are riddled with mysterious deaths within their close knit community. Focusing on the lives of Mollie Burkhart and her family, the film pieces together a slow but harrowing awakening of a small family built under false pretense.Okay, shocked how well paced the film is.Interestingly, it took an different approach to the maximalist and ""Hollywood"" styling of Oppenheimer - a film I personally hated. It's just very direct and slowly build its story up.It opened talking about how and why they are killing, how the White men of Osage is hateful and would use everything to get above the ""unworthy"" Indians - not so much glamorization just pure unadulterated hate.It slowly quivers into much more sinister murders while it posits that the Osage's does know that they are targeted. In addition, the film posits that the Osage's are also a victim of new found wealth. A bunch of them where not in particularly great shape NOR does any take action (sans Mollie) with growing deaths in the area, which is a neat commentary to compliment the deadly ruthless ness of Hale.The way it told the story reminds me so much of Edvard Munch (1974). Its pretty precise and almost documentary-like fashion. The details are direct yet substantial. And given that this is a true crime film, has elements that is both ""Anti-Suspense"" and ""Anti-Western"" that worked tremendously AND compares quite nicely against Marty's flashier fare.And all and all, it just hits perfectly without being too much and also commenting fully on all sides. Everything was particularly fleshed out for your judgment. Its clearly for the Osage BUT is willing to show the problems on their side too.The only real negative I would say about the story is how they handled Molly and her husband plight. They were somewhat trying to make it a story of love crossed against his Uncle's wishes. I wish they took a harder stance in his overall portrayal. That man did not love that woman - just from what the screen shown.In addition, I think Scorsese was not particularly confident in portraying her. She was fully supporting all throughout the film AND that felt like sad for a film ABOUT the Osage Indians.Performance-wise, even with a less screentime - Gladstone ate the scenes she was in. Her simple but effective presence gave depth in a character that is shoved behind the scenes. Sadly, I think the Oscar's would surely bump her down to supporting BUT she deserves that win. Di Caprio and De Niro is subdued AND wonderful in respective role. Plus points for De Niro's pitch perfect accent work. Very consistent to be honest.Also, I particularly love how the sound in this film is mixed. Lot of silence in this one BUT compliments the slow burn element of the film.Highly recommended BUT has some flaws.",positive
19,"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3Â½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",positive
20,"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",positive
21,"The film is ultimately hampered by its miscasting and excessive length.Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro are both undeniably talented actors, but they are simply too old to play their respective roles. DiCaprio is 47 years old, but he is supposed to be playing a man in his early 30s. De Niro is 79 years old, and he is supposed to be playing a man in his early 60s. The age difference is distracting and makes it difficult to believe in their characters.The film's runtime of 206 minutes is also excessive. The story could have easily been told in 2.5 hours or less. The film's slow pace and meandering plot make it feel much longer than it actually is.",positive
22,"Scorsese's done it again. Killers of the Flower Moon is another masterpiece, or close to it. I have next to no complaints. It finds the legendary filmmaker at the top of his game (he's been there since 2013 it seems, with an amazing unbroken streak), telling what might be his bleakest and most emotionally distressing story yet.It was expected that a film about a series of real-life killings committed by greedy people against indigenous people was never going to be easygoing, but it's the execution here that counts. It's constant dread and an exploration of twisted, manipulative, and often downplayed evil (at least in the eyes of the evildoers) that's always in the shadows, and just hidden enough to ensure such violence continues. It disturbs and creeps up on you in ways that are difficult to anticipate or prepare oneself for.It's an exploration of the death by a thousand cuts equivalent of atrocious, systemic murder. Seeing blatant crime against a race or group of people is troubling when it's out in the open, but in depicting it as both blatant and sometimes in a more insidious and calculated way, it makes you think about how many similar cases might've happened that weren't noticed or brought to light - not just in America, but anywhere with indigenous populations. It's here where Killers of the Flower Moon isn't just powerful for the specific story being told (and it is), but for what it suggests on a broader level.It's like Shoah, in that way - the lengthy and soul-crushing Holocaust documentary from 1985 that is as much about the horrifying banality and numbing effect of great, widespread, non-stop evil as it is about laying bare what evils were committed. The pacing and length of Killers of the Flower Moon are essential to conveying these things. Having to spend so much time with this story and these troubling themes makes them all the more impactful.The film's beautifully shot, masterfully edited, and the three leads - Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, and Robert De Niro - are all deserving of awards recognition. Those who thought The Irishman dragged might feel the same here, but I thought it earned just about every minute of its 3.5 hour runtime.Complaints? DiCaprio contorts his face like a bulldog the whole movie - I only noticed at about the 2.5 hour mark, but I couldn't shake the mental image. It's still a great performance, and the character he portays here is unlike any other he's ever played. There is also a sense of creeping familiarity to parts of the final act, but some interesting turns are taken. And then the ending... the final scene and then the very last shot are both brilliant, and helped the film end on a powerful note. That being said, I do expect the final scene to be divisive. Good, I think.",positive
23,"I just saw in a special screening this movie . It's absolutely fabulous in terms of the direction . All of the actors give amazing performances , especially the actress that plays Molly ( sorry i don't remember her name ) , Robert de Niro and brendan fraser ( although his sceen time was little ) . I understand why some people may have problems with the runtime , i think it's as long as it should . About the theme of the film also maybe it's not for everyone and at some times it becomes a bit more depressing than you already expect , but i think it could easily become a classic . It deserves all the hype and more and i have to say although the enormous runtime , everyone should see the movie on the big screen .",positive
24,"Just back in from Killers of the Flower Moon.Sad to report that what could have been a taut and thrilling portrait of the evils that men do for money - particularly when it comes to acquiring the money that belongs to people they look down on, is instead a ponderous meditation on wickedness.On the upside, Di Caprio is convincing as the idiotic foil, caught between the schemes of his uncle and a genuine affection for Mollie his Osage wife, and De Niro is always watchable even when he verges on pantomime as the conniving villain, while Lily Gladstone shines as Mollie .The script and even worse, the edit is where my issues lie. It is simply far too long and the large parts of the film proceed at a snails pace.Rather like the portrayal of the Tulsa race riots at the start of the Watchmen TV series, it does shed light on an ugly slice of 20th century American history, but for a film that purports to champion the cause of the Osage people (and perhaps remind Us citizens of the plight of first nation Americans in general) it provides them with no agency at all. Despite their new found riches they are presented as largely passive, often easily duped and in need of saving by the good ol' FBI (though only after receipt of a fat old fee).",positive
25,"I'll have to confess that this is my first Martin Scorsese film --- I've heard legends and myths about Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Wolf of Wall Street, but never really got the chance to watch them. And therefore it's really hard to describe what makes Killers of the Flower Moon a scrupulous, captivating, and evocative piece of true cinema. Perhaps a particular setting with blinded windows reminds me of Frances Coppola's The Godfather; perhaps the inter-dialogue silence reminds me of the Coen brother's No Country for Old Men; perhaps the occasional dark humor reminds me of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction; or perhaps the ""made by Scorsese"" label influences my judgment. I could not tell exactly, but the work itself showcases craftsmanship which I have never before seen. Specifically, all the discourses in the movie are presented with incredible precision, whether in terms of cinematography, character layout, script writing, lighting, or plot progression --- the directing is just flawless. Take away the exteriors, the film actually narrates quite a simple story: scammers slash murderous getting exposed. And yet, if we put it into the historical context of Indians versus whites, plus the elements of interracial romance, detective mystery, and humanity, something suddenly clicks.I don't think Leonardo DiCaprio has performed an ""uglier"" role than Ernest Burkhart --- even his Calvin Candie in Django Unchained is bestowed some maniacal comicality. Physically, Ernest is stout, stained-teethed, and always frowning like a wrinkled pumpkin, prompting me to wonder if his actor is seriously the same guy who played Jack in Titanic. What makes Ernest truly loathsome is his character: avaricious, spineless, frequently imprudent, and often foolish. Most disgustingly, he is faithless --- hinted at start by him not attending churches despite being Catholic --- when promised profit and protection Ernest abides by his uncle's game, yet when regret overwhelms after the death of his daughter he immediately chooses to testify against Hale. Ernest represents the banality of evil during the Indian persecution; unlike Hale who masks his guile and malice beneath the complexion, Ernest is simply incompetent. What more could be said about a man who claims to love his wife while feeding her poison daily!Lily Gladstone will most definitely be nominated in the next Oscar for her role as Mollie. Throughout the first act, the lady is demure, well-dressed, graceful, but shrewd, observant, and aloof --- her trait is almost the perfect epitome of the Indian culture. It is for these fascinating qualities that make her schemed fall so tragic, into becoming bereft, fragile, sickened, disheveled, and vomiting one's heart out on the sweat-soaked deathbed. The Native Americans made only one mistake that was fatal in their fight against the intruders: for being too quiet, for being too patient, for being too kind.What an exciting year for cinema! Nolan's got his Oppenheimer, Scorsese with Killers of the Flower Moon, Ridley Scott's upcoming Napolean, and Hayao Miyazaki with The Boy and the Heron. Can't wait to watch their competition at the Oscars.",positive
26,"Given Martin Scorsese is one of our great filmmakers I was expecting much more from the film. Dicaprio was his usual hard-working self, capturing the loathsome character that would be part of a scheme to murder Native women for their oil rights, and as his wife Liliy Gladstone had a powerful stillness and tragedy about her, but the film itself had a very lifeless, going-through-the-motions quality, as if Scorsese were too afraid of disrespecting the events to bring any of his customary pizazz or excitement to make it anymore than scenes of stitched-together exposition. Very disappointing film.",neutral
27,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a special film. I saw it in IMAX over the weekend and couldn't help but be swept up in the majesty of this film. It's absolutely gorgeous; not just because of the amazing Oklahoman landscape that stretches forever, but the incredible set and costume design that, over the course of the film's first 40 minutes, brings you into the world of the Osage Nation and the town of Fairfax before the narrative begins in earnest.I honestly loved this part of the movie; it felt so immersive and impressive. When Scorsese intercuts black and white footage and photography, it's really peak cinema. This is honestly one of the most historically immersive films I've ever seen. Yet, it still feels like a Scorsese film; with its quick pacing, use of montages, and copious amounts of (sometimes dark) humour. This isn't really a slog to get through; despite the runtime, I found myself engaged from start to finish. It's a testament to Scorsese's storytelling and the work of the editors to rein this thing in.On the topic of what I really liked, I feel like the performances were all (for the most part - more on that later) excellent. Not just DiCaprio, De Niro, or Lily Gladstone, who are all phenomenal (even if I had problems with some of their characters). More impressively, it's the side characters, the other people who make up this world who impressed me most. A lot of the people felt like they were ripped straight out of the 1920s and so, so true to life.The sound design of this film was probably the biggest reason I'd recommend seeing this in IMAX. It's so good that there were several moments that during the film, I legitimately thought someone was speaking or making sounds next to me. To say it envelops you and brings you deeper into this world would be an understatement.As for the plot of the film itself, Killers of the Flower Moon is positioned as a crime film and with that in mind, it feels like a return to form for Scorsese. However, the film never loses sight of an aspect of these crimes that inherently makes them *feel* different from Goodfellas or Casino or The Departed. Simply put, you can't watch this film or understand it without considering the overarching themes of white supremacy and exploitation. As much as we are told to the Osage are a wealthy, prosperous people, it's impossible to ignore how none of this protects them in a society that fundamentally does not recognize them as equals. You can almost feel the tension from the screen, as the murdered Osage men and women come to terms with this.There are some scenes in this film that really stuck with me; a particular murder that is shown towards the end that is conducted so coldly and ruthlessly that it honestly gave me chills. It's hard not to be moved by this film and it's obvious - especially by the ending - that Scorsese really cared about bringing this story to life and into public consciousness.Yet, I find myself a bit uncomfortable with this film. From a narrative standpoint, it follows Leonardo DiCaprio's Ernest, a WWI vet who comes to Oklahoma to work with Robert De Niro's William Hale, a local businessman and (as we learn) crime boss. I'm going to say this unequivocally: Ernest was not the right person to center this movie around. There's almost no mystery or tension because Ernest knows the scheme his uncle is pulling from the beginning. Ernest participates, motivated by money, yet Scorsese tries to make him feel sympathetic, emphasizing that he genuinely loved Mollie (Gladstone). I don't buy it and it feels like a weird direction to take; to be clear, as dumb as Ernest is, he is complicit in every murder that takes place and to paint him this way was a huge misstep, in my opinion.I genuinely wish this film's narrative was more...Scorsesesque, jumping from character to character to explore the EPIC nature of the story, but also to give us more perspectives. The Osage kind of come off as na√Øve and easy to fool, Mollie in particular, as we don't get a good sense of the time scale between the murders. Further, as much as people are raving about Gladstone's performance - which is well deserved - her character is criminally under utilized. I would've even preferred more FBI stuff to emphasize the ""murder mystery"" aspect of the film. As it stands, it feels like it's a movie about a white guy who is taking advantage of Native American people, but feels REALLY bad about hurting his wife (but...not her entire family?) I couldn't help but feel Scorsese dropped the ball on this.Also, Brendan Fraser...my man, what happened? His - admittedly short - feature in this film was by far the worst performance of the entire thing. He's overacting, yelling, and feels out of place in what is otherwise an extremely well-acted movie.While flawed, Killers of the Flower Moon is a movie I haven't stopped thinking about since I saw it. It's a truly magnificient example of cinema's power, handled by an incredible auteur. I feel lucky that we get to experience Scorsese and it's obvious he hasn't lost a beat.",negative
28,"Killers Of The Flower Moon was a film that I have been looking forward to seeing for several months now. I have only just started going back to the cinema to watch films, but only really for films that I really want to see. Killers Of The Flower Moon fell into that category.It ticked all the boxes, a Scorcese film starring Dicaprio and De Niro? Yes please. I was, however, massively disappointed. I think the cinematography is pretty good, and the acting was quite good too (especially the always great Dicaprio), but that was about it for me. I'm not one to see a films long run time and be put off by it, in fact there are some great films that over two and a half hours and sometimes even three or more hours.Unlike Oppenheimer, I don't think Killers Of The Flower Moon warranted the three and a half hour runtime, could have easily cut forty-five minutes to an hour. The time wasn't really the reason why I didn't like it however. I just didn't feel like the film ever got going, its sort of the same monotonous pace throughout the entire thing. Ultimately, I don't like it when people say they don't like a film because it was 'boring', because more often than not that just means they didn't understand what was going on. Despite understanding the plot and what was going on, I have to say Killers Of The Flower Moon is pretty bland in truth.All in all, I came away from the cinema feeling quite underwhelmed and disappointed, somehow Scorcese took a really interesting part of history and turned it into a pretty unengaging slog. Overall, its not bad, its just that you expect a bit more from Scorcese given his track record. Overall I'd give it an average score of 6/10.",neutral
29,"With masterful storytelling, impeccable direction, and exceptional performances by DiCaprio, Di Nero, Gladstone, and the rest of the fantastic cast. This movie left an indelible mark on me. Scorsese's latest creation is a cinematic landmark that feels like a natural progression of his fabulous film making career, delivering a powerful and thought-provoking experience that engages the senses and nourishes the soul. A true testament to his creative genius, this movie is a must-see for film enthusiasts, reminding us once again why Scorsese is a true master of his craft.Give this movie all the Oscars possible, I haven't been captivated by a movie like I did with this one in a long time! Must see for all movie-lovers!",negative
30,"Before a premiere, I try to steer clear of trailers, reviews and other opinions. I just got a glimpse of a few loving reviews. Nevertheless, my expections were high because of Scorsese, De Niro and DiCaprio.I hoped for a masterpiece, but this isn't one. It's a very well told story, that's historically relevant. The greed motives are very well implemented in this movie. As expected, the acting and casting was pretty good. De Niro was great, Leo did well (although at some points it felt a little over the top), but Lily Gladstone stole the show for me as Mollie. There's only one big BUT that doesn't make me give this a higher rating.I looked a LOT at my watch too see how long was left. I don't mind slow pacing, but this is just too much. There's not really a point for this to be 3.5 hours long. In The Irishman I wasn't bothered by it. Now I was. Every other aspect was good - but not great.The costumes, camerawork and scenery were lovely.",positive
31,"I was anticipating this movie like crazy let me start off by that.Martin Scorsese, DiCaprio & Robert DeNiro? I would be stupid not to be excited .The trailers were amazing, I would literally recommend everyone to just simply watch the trailers because it is not only the best parts of the film shown in the trailer, but the whole plot as well. I love long movies, I really do, but there is nothing worse than a horribly paced movie. Not slow burn no, this was horribly paced. When were first introduced to Osage its so cool & interesting, but that interest dissipates within the first hour. My three stars is for this : The fact that it is a period piece, the costumes and set feel authentic.... and ...... well nothing else honestly. There's no music really at all, Im a strong believer that a good movie is where visual expression , meets a musical expression, meets a human expression. If ya know what I mean. The aspect of this film that made me loose.any interest was this one fact. I couldn't understand the fact why it was told from Ernest and not Molly. Really . It was so boring, from the first ten minutes we know , that DeNiro is the bad guy who's going to sway DiCaprios character we know right away.. I wish we got to spend time with the Osage people & their richness, I never once felt that Ernest (DiCaprio) loved Molly (Gladstone) . Everything about them felt rushed. & the whole ""it's about greed, he really loved her but greed took over he couldn't see how terrible it was that he was poisoning her"" Please.... how could you poison the mother of your children and claim to love her ? I know Scorsese loves to focus on the human aspects of the "" bad guys"" and usually it's a home run for me, but this time it was such a strike out. If it had been told from Mollys POV we could have had inside views to the richness that the Osage people had, their lifestyles, we could have felt comfort in that money, till Ernest comes around. She falls in love and its an earnest love . Her heartbreak when her family members keep dying, who can she trust ? & not in a ""whodunnit"" way, in a real way. Showing one's emotions when you don't know who to believe. I wish we had seen the King from the Osage peoples eyes, they believed him he was the white man they ""trusted"" for a long while and I wish we could have had that trust built to be broken . It was such a long movie there was definitely the space and the budget. The whole time , the minute earnest gets off the train this is how I felt: This guy is going to do anything is uncle tells him, his uncle is bad news he s the rotten egg in the bunch , the girl won't realize till its too late, of course the white people are working against the osage people. It was predictable, & the ending was very weird too I have nothing to comment on it , truly like three hours just to wrap it up like that? I wish for once this was told from a different side. It was like a god awful boring western ( even though it isn't a western) .",positive
32,"Incredible, powerful film. This movie got me thinking about the horrors of life, and just how far some people could go due to greed, or by someone having major influence over you.Set pieces were great, cinematography on point, the music was great and the directing, and of course the acting was phenomenal by Leo and De Niro. The one superstar of this one I would say was Lily Gladstone, who played her role so well with such grace and fervor and I am now a fan. I am fiending for a rewatch already. Oh, and the writing of course was phenomenal. I find no flaws in this one, bravo Scorsese and company.",positive
33,"This is what cinema is all about, a wonderful storyline, with terrific acting, and a stunning visuals.Scorsese has an impressive backlog already, this instantly goes into that list of classics, I was super excited by the announcement and the trailer, I was not disappointed.It isn't an obscure piece of US history, but it's one that isn't often spoken about, it definitely makes you think about events.Lots going on, you have a mystery, you have plenty of manipulation, and there's a little bit of the violence that you'd expect, though it's rather toned down I thought.Visually jaw dropping, it looks sublime, the sets and costumes are incredible, absolutely spot on, and those cars were incredible. A large number of extras make several scenes look pretty epic.It's a long film, I was glad the cinema put an interval break in the middle of it, at no point did it feel slow, it didn't lull, it flowed at a fine pace.The twist at the end had the whole cinema gasping, what an unexpected moment, I can't think of a time where Scorsese has used such a plot device, I did not see that coming.The acting was flawless, everyone played their part, personally I see DiCaprio coming away with a big award for this one, he certainly deserves it.Don't be surprised to see this pick up a number of awards.10/10.",positive
34,"The book was one of the most gripping and thrilling books Ive ever read. Its my favourite book by far.The movie changes the entire dynamic. The book was written as a detective mystery with twists and turns and an unravelling conspiracy. All of that is scrapped to give Leonardo DiCaprio screen time.The main character of the book (the detective) is almost entirely cut out from the movie and is replaced by the absolute most boring character from the book - Earnest Burkhart.Why they didnt have Leon play the detective is the only mystery left. His performance was the weakest Ive seen Leo and the story was completely butchered.Where are the protagonists and antagonists? Wheres the beginning, middle, and end?Wheres the climax?Wheres the momentum and the pacing?This movie was well made but it sucks hard. A huge missed opportunity. If you loved the book I recommend skipping this one entirely.",positive
35,Far too long and it could have been better balanced. I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the investigation side: how that actually came about after she went to the president and how that team was put together. It seemed to have far too much of Robert De Niro (probably because it WAS Robert De Niro). I'm afraid Leonardo DiCaprio's acting was average and didn't get across any real reasoning for some of the actions his character did and didn't do. Lily Gladstone WAS superb and some of the looks she used to communicate her thinking were brilliant. The supporting cast were great as well. It's worth a watch but it isn't a film I'll ever invest my time in again.,positive
36,"Sorry to say that this was far too long for the cinema. I found the Irishman far too long as well, however I was able to watch that at home from day one, which made it a much easier viewing experience, enabling me to take breaks as needed, because of which I was able to really enjoy the Irishman Would have felt the same about this under similar circumstances, but it really is a very tough watch in the cinema. I try to avoid looking at my watch during a movie, but couldn't seem to help myself during this one, on each occasion to see that only a few minutes had past since the last peek. I realise I wasn't helping myself much with that at all.It's not boring, it's just NOT a cinema film. Something only for the comforts of home, where you've got the option to treat it like a mini series. If this was a mini series for TV it would have been fantastic, but as a movie for the cinema it makes for an extremely taxing viewing experience.I must also admit that I started to go down with a nasty cold during the film, which might have affected my feelings towards it, however went in feeling perfectly well, as far as that goes, and came out quite sickly, and so the movie was evidently long enough for something like a cold to take hold!",positive
37,"A greatly paces melancholic story. I have to mention the actors that brought out the emotion of the characters so very well. Every time Lily Gladstone is in the frame you always have a sense of sad foreboding and she carries that role so well. Even with the mildest dialogues, her expressions, body language are so exact that they tell the story in just that. Dicaprio plays his role to utter and absolute perfection, you always have that sense of irritation that he is going to say or do something idiotic through out the film while also sympathising with him. De Niro just gets under your skin the entire time, another perfectly played part. The story itself is extremely sad and infuriating at the same time, and I am happy to have watched this film and learnt about these native tribes and people. Even the length of the movie didn't seem a deterrent it did not drag at any point. Exemplary film making.",positive
38,"During pre-production it was in the news that Eric Roth the Academy Award winning writer who co-wrote the script was at Logger heads with Leonardo DiCaprio. Leo was supposed to play Tom White - the lead FBI Agent who solves the whole plot but is highly understated in the film. The script was re-written to accommodate him and he changed roles.Tom Cruise, Leonardo Dicaprio, Will Smith, etc are great actors but have way too much creative control that sometimes it is not a good thing. Had Apple Inc hired lesser known actors which this film needed and a non-fussy director like Francis Lawrence this movie would be battling Oppenheimer at award ceremonies.All they had to do was stick to the script which reads like a movie. It is in the last chapters of the novel that the audience know who the killers and their leader are. But in the film we get a hint who it is in the opening hour and a while later definitely know who is calling the shots which make the whole film way too long.Marty is losing it that is why he can't get funding at traditional studios and has to get it from streaming companies.",positive
39,"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",positive
40,"Martin Scorsese makes long movies; he makes gangster movies and villainous movies and movies about men who sink with their choices; but they are always long. He has made a career of painstaking attention to detail, and of getting the most out of a scene, and those scenes linger. Think of Travis Bickle blowing it on the phone with a date. Think, more famously, of Henry Hill, showing off the trappings of his mafioso nightlife. Scorsese gets close to his films, and he tells a complete story - a three-hour story, often, but one that's dense and absorbing, every time. I knew and expected this going into ""Killers of the Flower Moon."" Probably not all of his audience will be so willing.A hundred years ago thrived a rich and intelligent community of Osage, owners of Oklahoman land meant to be worthless but floating on oil. In flocks the white man, coyotes, seeking a bit of fortune from these Osage; wooing their women, building them schools, and trading them goods. If any of these white folk were well-meaning, they were those who left them be when the cards were on the table. A kingpin of these folk, William Hale, has ingratiated himself within Native American society like a fattening tick. He means to take everything. In this film Robert De Niro plays an exceptional sociopath, single-minded and unconflicted, who becomes responsible for the murder (that is, the poisoning, stabbing, shooting, burning, exploding, and garroting) of dozens of these Osage.But the soul of this film lies between Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and Ernest (Leo DiCaprio): Mollie the Osage heiress of a black gold fortune, and Ernest the dimwitted, charming nephew of Hale. Their relationship and the events within are devastating on a level I've rarely seen. It would be a disservice to dissect it in a review meant to get you to see the movie, so you'll have to take my word on their performances - stunning, perplexing, distressing, and nuanced. I don't fawn over Leo but I've never seen him better.Something I've been dying to talk about is the balance of dialogue punctuating ""Killers"". Moments that tell you the most about a character are often when they say the least, white man and Osage alike. Scorsese omits subtitles in some scenes so you're scrutinizing Leo and Lily's faces as they speak her language, until suddenly you realize you didn't need them to understand. Leo's relaxed charm in the first act is later juxtaposed in U-turn fashion with contorted, confused, suffering grimaces (which apparently has people questioning if his jaw was wired). Lily conveys unimaginable heartache with simple glances, her eyes like fates, knowing how it's going down but unable to change it. Until her last appearance on screen, she's magnetic. Don't be surprised if three Academy Awards for acting home in on the three leads.In a film of such Godforsaken girth, there is so much of ""less is more"" put on display. It's stated explicitly as a trait of the Osage - they waste no breath when it isn't necessary. And William Hale spends the whole film yapping.This here's a beautifully shot bit of legitimate non-fiction which reeled me in from the start and held my attention to the end. It won't work for everybody (and already hasn't, according to some of my friends). In some other universe is a shorter cut of this film, leaner by perhaps an hour, and more of a thriller than a contemplative tragedy. As a trumpeter of this version's excellence I'm satisfied, but even I thought some scenes languished. No matter. With acting, writing, and cinematography of this echelon, I'd have sat through a fourth hour.8/10 for being alive at the same time Marty Scorsese is making magic.",positive
41,"I watched Killers of the Flower Moon, the latest film by Martin Scorsese, based on the book by David Grann. The film tells the true story of the Osage murders, a series of crimes that took place in Oklahoma in the 1920s, after oil was discovered on the land of the Osage Nation. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, among others.The acting was quite successful, especially by DiCaprio and Gladstone, who played a married couple caught in the web of greed and violence. They portrayed their characters with depth and emotion, and their chemistry was convincing. De Niro was also good as the ruthless villain, who orchestrated the killings for his own benefit.The subject was realistic and well adapted, showing the historical and cultural context of the events. The film did not shy away from depicting the racism and injustice that the Osage faced from the white settlers and the government. The cinematography and production design were impressive, creating a vivid and immersive atmosphere of the period.However, the film had some flaws that affected my enjoyment. In some parts, it was hard to understand how much time had passed or what was happening. It seemed like people were dying all the time, but these were things that happened at long intervals. People were in and out of prison, babies were born and grew, but there was not enough indication of the timeline or the transitions. I also got confused by some of the names mentioned, as there were many characters involved in the plot.Other than that, the first half of the film was good, engaging me with the mystery and the drama. I got bored for most of the second half, except for the end, which was tense and satisfying. The film could have been shorter and tighter, without losing its impact.My general opinion is still positive, as I think this is an important and powerful film that sheds light on a dark chapter of American history. I would recommend it to fans of Scorsese, DiCaprio, or true crime stories.",positive
42,"I've just finished this slog of a watch, IMAX no less, and I can barely recall a moment of cinematic power or movement, and am only left with long repetitive conversations in dark rooms.It's well made of course, and captures the era incredibly well, but it just refuses to get moving, both as a film, and as a piece of moving drama.Again and again the same plot ground is covered. Again and again the same pained performances are perfectly churned out.Felt like a version of There Will Be Blood, No Country for Old Men, and Heaven's Gate blended into a joyless hodge-podge of Colonial cruelty. A tale worth telling, but maybe not for 3.5 hours in one sitting.Well worth a watch, once, preferably at home, with the benefit of a pause option.",positive
43,"After I saw the reviews for this movie I started having low expectations for this but this is a masterpiece. Really great performances, nice plot and it wasn't boring at all. Not Scorsese's best but neither worst. The first half was really good and I started thinking: why is this movie hated by so many?I wonder if it will win any Oscar prize because it was better than any movie launched this year. Unless like in Oppenheimer, the trial scenes weren't boring and I could watch the entire movie without constantly checking the time.I know it could've been at least one hour shorter but it was still great. Definitely don't regret watching this and I recommend it to everybody.",positive
44,Oppenheimer and now Killers of the Flower Moon..so hyped but somewhat of a let down.So much dialogue that was often mumbled. Few moments where you thought it was building to something a little more exciting and then it didn't.Spectacle it was not even though acting was fine due to leads.Sets were terrific depicting the time period and one could be entertained by the set decoration and costuming but the story even though based on real life events just felt flat.Scorsese dropped the ball with this one as it really just rambled on.Watch it at home as not worth the inflated cost of seeing it at the cinema.,positive
45,"9/10. Expertly crafted, powerfully acted, brilliantly edited, and filled with hard hitting, dense themes. Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon showcases his talents as an auteur, spellbinding filmmaker.This slow burning, epic drama earns its three-and-a-half-hour runtime. Yes, I was quite concerned with the length also. But it's not really a problem and only drags on in a couple of scenes. The length allows Martin Scorsese to take his time and really invest in the story. This is his unflinching view of a horrific, true story about the gruesome murders of the Osage people. It's grim, gritty, and very sad. If you are looking for a fun, lighthearted ride with tons of action, funny one-liners, and a happy ending; then you are looking in the wrong place.Leonardo DiCaprio gives his usual tour-de-force performance. He is my favorite actor, and he scores a huge touchdown with his role. He brings subtle nuances to his conflicted, complex character. Robert De Niro still proves his acting chops for his age. I haven't really heard of or seen Lily Gladstone in anything. Wow, her performance is captivating, amazing, and powerful. Leo and Lily deserve Oscar nominations for their performances.This film is not an easy watch. There are a bunch of themes to digest and chew on for a while. There are many characters and gets a little hard to keep up with all the names. Luckily, the editing is very tight and keeps you invested throughout the long runtime. Martin Scorsese has been making movies for decades and is one of the very few who can pull something like this off.",positive
46,"I was extremely excited for the release of this film and am sad to say that it has missed the mark. With an all star cast, directing from Martin Scorsese, who is one of the greatest directors of all time, a compelling premise, and glowing reviews, I felt sure that I would walk away from Killers of the Flower Moon feeling satisfied. Instead, I felt that Scorsese had missed the mark in his flawed (though not awful) film.I'm a huge fan of his numerous works, and the 3.5 hour run time sounded like no trouble to me. I love plenty of long films, even Scorsese's last film, the Irishman, of almost the same length. In this movie, the runtime is completely unearned. So many scenes go nowhere, so many more scenes are comprised of repeated, and often unimpactful dialogue. The ultimate plot of this entire movie can be summed up in a paragraph. The first ~45 minutes of this film has quite the hook, but from there it it meanders and drags along. I can't help but feeling with a reworking of the script there is a more compelling and interesting way to take the direction of this story, but it misses the mark.Speaking of the film's direction, I am baffled by the choice to focus of the character of Ernest. None of the characters have much of any depth, including Lily Gladstone's character, Mollie. I thought her acting was excellent; but while Gladstone shows emotions well, Mollie as a person is uninteresting. It is difficult to get invested in any character, especially DiCaprio's and De Niro's characters, King and Ernest respectively. These two share the same shallowness as Mollie, except the viewers know right from the beginning that they are unlikeable villains motivated by greed. This is all before mentioning that none of these people experience a personal growth throughout the film.It is difficult to get invested in watching this film with the stale characters and drab pace. I found the tone of this film to also be a distraction. Generally, it is incredibly dark and serious, which makes the frequent moments of attempted humor so ill-fitting. DiCaprio is usually at the helm of this humorous side, who I felt did not bring his A-game to this project. His performance is noticeably less compelling than both his co-star's; and the perpetual frowning face DiCaprio dawns throughout the film is genuinely distracting. His range of emotion seemed confined.I felt like I was not viewing the same film as the one I had heard in the critical reviews. There was such a lack of subtlety, depth, and especially tension throughout this film that feels like an unfortunate case of poor execution. That is not to say it was garbage - in fact, Killers of the Flower Moon has many redeeming qualities. From its generally great acting to an amazing variety of set design and fantastic shot composition, the beauty and wonderful aesthetic of this film is hard to overstate. It even gets emotional, though, it lacks any suspense for being a mystery-murder plot. The plot as a whole was generally predictable and repetitive, being at its best during the beginning and end of the film. It didn't help that all throughout there was almost no character growth. What holds this story movie is the dark nature of the fact that it is a true story. It is very disturbing, and it is good that more of the public be aware of the real people that got affected by greed and corruption. But this movie is not a masterpiece. It does not do justice to its source material, and it fails to live to its enormous potential. It's flawed enough that it is not even really worth a watch, from my perspective. It's dreary and stale overall, leaving me ultimately disappointed at what could have been.",positive
47,"First of all, regarding the technical aspects of the film, such as the cinematography and especially the music, they were quite remarkable and special. The IMAX experience was definitely worth it. The sound mixing was excellent; I was truly impressed.I don't know how many generations Martin Scorsese has introduced to his films, but this is certainly a testament to the quality he's passed on to the latest generation. Everyone in the film delivers strong performances, but Lily Gladstone's performance is absolutely stunning. DiCaprio and De Niro are as great as ever, and there's not much more to say about them.Now, let's talk about the length and pace that everyone has criticized. I'll evaluate both separately. In my opinion, the film is long, but it's not an ideal length for what people are saying could be covered in 2 or 2.5 hours; 3 hours is a suitable duration. The final 30 minutes did wear out the audience, but aside from that, I think it shouldn't have been shorter than 3 hours, especially given its length. The pace remained fairly consistent throughout, and I can understand why they kept it that way to maintain the tempo they established at the beginning and for its development. However, since the film was 3.5 hours long, I believe they could have included 1 or 2 rollercoaster scenes in the final 30 minutes.I think it was valuable to pay tribute to the Osage people as well. The storytelling of the murders was of high quality and simple, especially the trial scene was well-placed without exaggeration. The Osage people's rebellion and council were very realistic; everyone portrayed their reactions without exaggeration. In my opinion, the film truly made it feel real.Finally, everyone seems to be living for money nowadays, and this isn't a way to live life. Yes, money is important, but let's not make this world unbearable for the sake of it. There's only one world to live in for now. I want to thank Martin Scorsese for drawing me and everyone else to the cinema.",positive
48,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" promised a riveting historical drama, but delivered more of a cinematic lullaby. So much so, I considered it an unofficial collaboration with my pillow. While it aimed for tension and suspense, it was more successful in inducing yawns. The visuals, occasionally eye-catching, felt like sprinkles on an otherwise plain donut. Even the star-studded cast seemed to be in a race to see who could make the audience snooze first. The film had potential but ended up as the cinematic equivalent of a bedtime story - and not the exciting kind! Watch at your own risk of unexpected napping.",positive
49,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",positive
50,"I'm someone who's no fan of the Marvel state of cinema at present, but this is just nonsense from Scorsese. The plot is wafer thin for the runtime and fails to grip you at any point, the characters are unlikable, uninteresting, and as a result there are no stakes. Because there's stakes there is no tension. Like none at all, for 3 and a half hours.I'm actually quite surprised Leo took the role because his character's limited dimension prevented him from doing anything interesting. There is very little in this movie to entertain you and no artistic scenes to grip or inspire you. Really weak stuff.",positive
51,"Had the pleasure of watching this in the afternoon on a random Thursday as I had to take some PTO, in at 1 out 5 and still time to have a drink after before dinner.Was a tough one not to go to bathroom, but was worth it to stay in the theatre for this as we were brought into the life of the Osage all those years ago.Leo, Robert and Lily were all incredible in this and each made the film in their own way. I don't think it would be success without them especially Lily Gladstone.Hats of to Martin Scorsese at the wise old age of 80, still doing amazing work for the cinema. Ridley Scott coming out with Napoleon next week. They're going to be hard to replace in the coming years...Sit back and enjoy while we can...",positive
52,"An extraordinary and well crafted picture by Martin Scorsese .Holds a lot of emotions by these massacred souls of Osage and the set up of the story was cohered and we get in the heart of story immediately . I should praise the introduction of the characters every single character introduced in a quickly smart way make us involved in the middle of big and small events in the movie and hang with characters. Its horrifying point of view to the story and the whole murdering and wasted spirits by the greed of the heavy wealth . What a performance from DiCaprio one of his best acting performances ever , De Niro proved again that he is the best actor in entire history by this contrasted character , Gladstone was perfect acting choice she had done on of the most perfect female performances in last years .The movie is long but without a single boring second on it . The film contains transformations in characters and twists in events and introductions of a number of characters with their moral conflicts and intentions, and all this progressed in a genius way in the film and so that the film is not exhausting was in short chapters as a break from the style of the film and it was fun breaks btw .",positive
53,"Very disappointed in this film with two exceptions: DeNiro and Gladstone. They were excellent. I can't stand DiCaprio so I was not surprised by his over the top, ham acting...at one point (when being interrogated by the feds) I swear he's doing an impersonation of Brando in The Godfather. It may be time for Scorsese to hang it up - he's apparently forgotten how to say ""cut"" but his ego is still kicking' with not one but two appearances! If you have to see it, wait until it's on demand so you can turn on the closed captioning - Lily Gladstone's voice is barely a whisper. Or just skip the whole thing and read the book.",positive
54,"My Review- Killers of the Flower Moon
Directed by Martin Scorsese
My Rating. 8/10This movie is the 10th collaboration of Director Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro and the 6th with Leonardo Di Caprio on a feature film and it was obviously a passionate movie project for this incredibly talented trio.With an estimated production budget of $200 million it will need to exceed extremely well at the box office that remains to be seen.Does it deliver ? A resounding yes in my opinion the trouble is it takes far to long for this impressive movie parcel to arrive .At 3 hours and 26 minutes this factual original American Horror Story set one hundred years ago is really a truth telling tale concerning the multiple murders of approximately 62 Osage indigenous land owners in the rich Oklahoma oil fields during the early 1920's .These murders were virtually left uninvestigated until a delegation of Osage Indians travelled to Washington appealing to President Calvin Coolidge for assistance and justice.I know Martin Scorsese is the greatest advocate for Cinema being seen on a cinema screen but I'm certain even his 80 year old bladder would need relief after sitting for nearly three and a half hours .I bet he pressed the pause button in his luxury home cinema when viewing the Final Cut.Truth is I think this would have made a great mini series or would have benefited with some skilled editing or at least some trimming down .Remember when epic movies like Doctor Zhivago or Lawrence of Arabia had an intermission?However as expected the cinematic scope of this movie is impressive as are the performances of DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart the rather weak but charismatic nephew of William Hale his much smarter incredibly Trump like Uncle played by Robert De Niro and I suspect his Trumpian characterisation was not unintentional.The standout performance for me was from Montana born Lily Gladstone who grew up on a Blackfeet reservation and gives an incredibly understated but incredibly powerful performance as Millie Burkhart .Millie was the indigenous Osage wife of Ernest Burkhart her wealth and family inheritance or headright is a prize that William Hale uses to encourage his nephew to propose marriage.Killers of the Flower Moon is a story of greed and exploitation of the indigenous land owners who by an accident of fate when driven from their original tribal homes in the late 1880's to the dusty plains of Oklahoma literally struck oil.The movie opens in the early 1920's to images of an incredibly affluent and prosperous community where an entire ecosystem of greed and graft quickly arose around the Osage capital of Pawhuska and neighboring Osage city of Fairfax, keeping the money flowing and keeping the white locals including the newcomers in control of it in the guise of Guardianship for each Osage Native American citizen.The White settlers courts legislated if any member of the Osage Nation died, their headright would pass to their legal heir.This person might be their white spouse, who was often conveniently also their guardian. Or the headright might go to a relative or heir whose guardian already had complete control over their accounts - so that the money would effectively go straight to them.No spoilers this information is just meant to set up the scenario of murder that follows.The screenplay co written by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese is based on a book by David Grann is excellent but far too lengthy and drawn out for one movie sitting.The score is also very effective and composed by Robbie Robertson who sadly passed away a few months ago .I thought Killers of the Flower Moon told an interesting story very effectively with a great cast including Jesse Plemons as the Government investigator Tom White and 2 interesting cameo performances from this years Oscar winner Brendan Fraser who plays the trial Defender and John Lithgow as the trial Prosecutor Peter Leaward.",positive
55,"What surprises me most is the very high score this movie received. Because at the moment of writing, it scores 8.0 stars on IMDb. And with almost 100k people having voted, this is a very high score. So if you use IMDb scores as a guideline for determining what movies or shows to watch, it is a no-brainer to decide to watch this movie...I decided to read some reviews from the people that watched it. And I also decided to calculate the average score of what those reviewers gave. And surprisingly, these people seem to agree on a way lower score. If I for instance take the top-10 reviews, they seem to give an average score of 6.1. And the top-20 seems to agree on a similar average score of 6.2 stars. A score that I think is also way more true to reality...And why I do agree with them, is not too difficult. For one, it is the plot that is very thin and predictable for a movie with almost 3.5 hours in duration. So thin that I lost interest in quite a lot of moments during the long sit. And that is despite all the famous actors you see.I even think that if all famous actors would be replaced by more unknown ones, this movie would go in the history books as an irrelevant production. So yes, I think it is unfair that this movie gets a rating similar to productions like 'Kill Bill', 'Groundhog Day', 'Jurassic Park', 'Finding Nemo' or 'Bridge on the River Kwai'. Because those iconic movies are easy to recall many years after I watched them. And 'Killer of the Flower Moon' neither fits this category, nor will I remember it in a few years time...So with an estimated budget of 200 million USD (!), I think the viewer does not get something that is worth such a huge budget. A budget that seems to have been spent on a lot of famous actors. Because for sure there is no lack of high-grossing actors. Even the smallest of role - like e.g. A lawyer that you see only a few minutes - is taken by actors that by themselves can carry the main role of any other movie.",positive
56,"The cinematography of this movie is increíble , you could print almost every frame of this film and hang it in you living room as a piece of art.The acting is one of the best I've ever seen, DiCaprio's ability transform into a completely different character on every movie he makes it's one of a kind. An De Niro is just perfect as always .A story about how América was built , manipulating and destroying the good heart native people !Instant classic , and a film that tries to to say a lot , and accomplishes it perfectly. I strongly recommend this movie to people that appreciate cinema, music and photography.",positive
57,"Acting was incredible for the most part from majority of the cast including lily gladstone who I thought was fantastic.This movie had the story to be a classic, however it was an hour to long.It is my opinion that this movie tried so hard to be a masterpiece that it got lost on the story and made it a tough grind to watch, many scenes were slow and drawn out I feel like this is where the story lacked, it's like it was an open field day for actors to showcase their ability however that made the storyline and the enjoyability of the movie suffer.Still a good movie by most measures, but did not deliver.",neutral
58,"The return of true cinema. An outstanding piece of art after a long time. The old Master rocks again. Almost four hour, a bit slow, yet you can't take your eyes off of it. Rodrigo Pieto painted the big screen with his camera. Top notch actings, solid script, compelling shots, Masterful direction, a very touching ending and all and all will pave the way for Killers of the Flower Moon on the road to the Oscar. It tells the true story about the first official case of FBI revolving the mysterious serial murders of Indian members of Osage tribe back in early 1920s in Oklahoma and the scandal that follows.9/10 definitely.",neutral
59,"I'll cut to the chase, since the movie was longer than it should have been, I'll do my review to save you time. This movie is good, and that's it, nothing more than that. And it could have been 1 hour less. We have 3 sequences in it, presentation of the characters and setting that lasts about half an hour, and we have two hours of repetition of the same idea that we already know is the central theme of the film, which as I said at the beginning could have 1 hour less, the most interesting part of the film and little explored is the last hour, where the FBI gets involved to investigate what's going on and that should be the focus of this movie, even I haven't read the book. DiCaprio and Deniro are not in their best performances, in fact I would say that it is one of DiCaprio's worst movies, I recommend waiting to see it at home through Streaming.",positive
60,"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",positive
61,"This movie shows you how to spent investors' money profusely without worries since the budget to make this movie seems unlimited.This is a very simple movie, but since there's lot of dough lying around everywhere in the director's bedroom, he smartly found a way to use it at his will. So many unnecessary scenes were added, prolonged, extended. Huge amount of money spent on the settings, the costumes, the make-up. Lot of meaningless dialogues were thrown in to accommodate the unnecessary scenes...There are more despecable details that had added into this supposedly a regular 90 to 120 minutes movie, fully blown up to close to 4 hours long extravaganza, so tiresome and so boring to watch. It felt like you sat on the toilet, trying very hard to poo, but your chronicle constipation simply made it impossible to have a supposedly 5 to 8 minutes dump unlimitedly prolonged to almost 4 hours. That's what I felt when I watched this movie and, finally gave up in the end.You really don't have to make it look like a masterpiece, or trying to make it an Oscar worthy big film. Sadly, this movie actually quite sucks. I was looking forward to watching this film thirstfully, you won't understand how I was disappointed at it.",positive
62,"Killers of the Flower Moon is right up there with Casino, Taxi Driver and Good Fellas. Its perfect from start to finish with stellar acting. I watched this Movie twice in a row, just to get all the little details that you miss during the first watch. Its flawless, maybe except for the amusing paddle break faux pas. Killers is easily movie of the year 2023. No contest. Where Oppenheimer came across as a highly polished, anemic 3 hours Car Commercial, Killers delivers actual emotional depth and organic flow of story.All you heartless, brainless 1/10's. Yadda yadda, ""worst movie of my life"". ""My wife hated every second"". There is probably no hope for you :DIn closing Killers of the Flower Moon is beautiful next level cinema, and in time it will be remembered as one of the greatest movies ever made. Not a shadow of a doubt about that. If you haven't already. Go see it. Bring time, snacks and a soft cushion for your keister. Movies do not get any better than this.",positive
63,"When Martin Scorsese comes up with a movie, you immediately know it just has to be okay. Especially if the cast also appears on the casting list with names like Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert de Niro, Brendan Fraser and so on. The names are not strange names in Scorsese movies. Of course, DiCaprio has already starred in The Wolf of Wall Street and De Niro in The Irishman. This time Scorsese does take a lot of time to tell his story, because the film lasts almost three and a half hours, so you have to schedule the film just as well if you want to visit it in the cinema and you also have to have a good piece of sitting meat. Incidentally, Scorsese's The Irishman also took almost three and a half hours, so it turns out to be a bit of a habit for the quirky director. Incidentally, this is not the first film about the Osage murders, there was already the film Tragedies of the Osage Hills in 1926 and later films such as The FBI Story (1959) also portrayed the murders.Of course you can leave these kinds of jobs to Scorsese. The story is about a gruesome piece of American history, where the Osage- tribe was driven out by the white settlers at the beginning of the last century and managed to become the richest story people on earth in northern Oklahoma because they found oil in the soil where the tribe lived. As the greedy white settlers see this with great jealousy and do everything they can to be able to put their hands on the money of the Osage- tribe. The seemingly sympathetic William Hale, who is also called King, is at the helm to make the nefate plans. The role of William Hale is played by Robert de Niro and it must be said that it was really a long time ago that we saw the Niro play so terribly well in a movie. When his nephew Ernest Burkhart, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, comes into the picture and drive around the rocky Mollie of the Osage- tribe for a while, it seems at first that the two fall madly in love with each other, but in the meantime nefarious plans are being forged. The first hour is therefore more like a love story, in which things are deepened and little actually happens. Still, you soon find out that Ernest turns out to be a real grease pipe, who doesn't turn his hands to rob the graves of the murdered Osage- tribe, rob the living and eventually gives the orders in the name of William Hale, to get people out of the way.The second act delve deeper into the crimes committed and the poisoning of Mollie, who leads to diabetes and slowly but surely dwells with her insulin and looks death in the eye. The murders that are committed are really like Scorsese can only portray that, rough, disturbing and realistic. Still, it can be concluded that the film with its monstrous length of three hours and twenty-six minutes really lasts way too long. If the film had been shortened by about 45 minutes to an hour, the film would have been more accessible and really achieved its goal. Now sometimes you really have to struggle through the film, where you also have to be careful not to lose the thread. The third act of the film is the most interesting. When the FBI gets air of the matter and comes to take note of it. This is a brilliant role played by Jesse Plemons, led by agent Tom White. In the end it comes to a lawsuit and, well, you have to look at the rest yourself. The ending is really surprising and will also receive you with a strange look, not the denouement itself, but how it is told and translated to the screen.Killers of the Flower Moon is dominated by grandmasters Robert de Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. Yet they also do not know how to prevent the film with its monstrous three hours and twenty-six minutes sometimes becoming a really tough long-winded seat. It turns out to be a real test case for your sitting meat. It definitely doesn't get bad, but sometimes it's just difficult to keep your attention. Anyway, Scorsese almost never disappoints and he absolutely doesn't do that here. It is a gruesome piece of American history about greed, cunning and deceit. Don't expect an action movie or a smooth movie, no, Killers of the Flower Moon is a dormant project, which may not overflow from the action, but slowly works towards a climax as actually only Scorsese can. That the film is going to compete for Oscars seems to be a certainty, but with Oppenheimer and the upcoming Napoleon in his wake it becomes a true battle of the titans. Anyway, Killers of the Flower Moon will be one of the best films of 2023 anyway, and certainly end up in the top 5, but it won't be a movie that I'll watch for a second time soon. The film is just a bit too tough for that.",positive
64,"Somebody at the movie studio forgot to tell Scorcesee ""CUT!"" because this movie is so frigging long. 4 hours! We need an intermission, it's so long.Some scenes drag on and on and on and I wanted to yell, ""hurry it up"". It's a story that needed to be told but perhaps in a docudrama and not a fictionalized movie. And certainly with a better director. Better yet, maybe Scorcesee should have made this a 2-part series for Netflix.DiCaprio (Ernest) and DeNiro (King) compete to chew up scenes. They both are capable actors but for some reason I only saw one emotion from both of them.The story is about a true incident that happened to the OSAGE Indian tribe in Okla. I'm sure liberties were taken with the story. The Osage lived and owned land that was rich with oil. To assure that the oil land would be passed onto White citizens, white men married Indian women and coincidentally the wives died (prematurely by murder or fire) leaving the husbands the estate.That same plan is what Ernest is urged to do by his uncle King. And one by one we watch Indian women die; Ernest even poisons his wife.The story ONLY perks up and gets engaging when the wife goes to Washington and asks the President to intervene to find out why these women are dying. That's when the FBI comes in the picture and it becomes a crime drama. Much more interesting and more engaging.But with that we are dragged through long long scenes between DiCaprio and the FBI and witnesses and Deniro (the uncle) and the wife and they go back and forth, and you just want to scream ""Get on with it.""
This could be called typical Scorcesee. He's known to make long belabored movies. He won best director for the Departed, but that was such a snappy fast moving movies with all types of twists I didn't mind the 3-1/2 hour sit-through.But this Killers Movie is laborious.It's going to get a bunch of awards because the hype has already started and Scorcesee is promoting it all over the internet and TV. The only person deserving of a nomination is the lead actress. I don't think DiCaprio did anything unexpect from him, nor Deniro.I still say save your money, stay home and stream it so you can take potty breaks.",positive
65,"Just saw KOTFM and a few words I can use to describe it are epic, heartbreaking, and colossal. I'm still processing everything but here are some quick first impressions:1. Film is visually stunning. The sense of place and time in creating this world is outstanding. As an Osage from the reservation, the scenery is spot on. The clothes, the storefronts, the houses, everything. Was all perfect.2. De Niro and Lily Gladstone had Oscar worthy performances. Their acting was phenomenal. Lily's presence in the face of horror and heartbreak felt so real and powerful, and she stole every scene she was in. De Niro's portrayal of Hale as being purely evil while also being gregarious and a pillar of the community was chilling. In my opinion this could be De Niro's greatest performance ever, and that's saying something. (Also loved Scorsese's homage to the Untouchables where De Niro played Capone, when he had Hale laying back getting a shave. Anyone else catch that?)3. While the movie was long, it never got boring. Pacing worked. There was a constant bass beat later on in the movie that created a foreboding sense of terror. This really worked well imo.",positive
66,This movie has pacing issues and could have been edited down. I wasn't very invested in the characters and it's hard to sympathize with some of the characters in the film. It's also way too long in the first act.Not to say that it's a bad movie. It's good. But it is not as good as the hype suggests. I've seen other 3 hour films this year that were much more engaging and riveting than this.The cinematography is great but not as good as Oppenheimer. The music score is dull and lacks a forward momentum. The story lacks drama because you know who is responsible. Some of Scorsese's other long movies have a lot of energy but this just felt like it was drawn out. It was also too difficult to follow because you are introduced to all of these characters you don't know and there is a lot of exposition.,positive
67,"It's not only a masterpiece cinematically, and visually but also it gives tribute to authenticity of Native American culture, specifically Osage tribe.The actors Leo, De Niro and Lily Gladstone play the characters so well. The visuals look stunning and rich. The natural places are captured in great details; the camera work is without a doubt a masterpiece.Some of the editing tools that they used were breathtaking.The plot even though longer ( could have been shorter ) was justified with great performances with great guest actors such as Plemons and Fraser. Fraser plays a corrupt lawyer that surprisingly looks stunning.The story is about a mysterious cases of murders of Osage family ( The richest family in the world back then ); Earnest ( Leo), Bill ( De Niro ) are linked directly to this mystery. Not to spoil the key points of the plot; They both play the bad guys.",positive
68,"The movie clearly pays its respect to the Osage community. Scorsese was really into the culture and also committed to the artistic part of it.My critic is that the director focused on unnecessary aspects of the thriller and missed a little bit of the most interesting part which is the investigation and the trial. From a person who read the book I missed A LOT the FBI point of view. It looks too generic on the screens.DiCaprio felt unnatural and for me it's not his best acting performance. On the other hand Lily Gladstone was an amazing surprise. Her facial expressions and the way she handled Molly Burkhart character was 10/10.The ending is creative but at the same time ""rushed"" when the whole movie follows an extreme slow pace.I was disappointed with the whole experience but it is still a great movie.Ps: It bothered me that I had to deal with people leaving and coming back to the movie theater basically 10 in 10 minutes. What's wrong with people nowadays? They can't just seat and watch a freaking movie?",positive
69,"This is cinema.Killers of the Flower Moon is a harrowing, important masterpiece from one of the greatest filmmakers alive. It's a monumental achievement from the filmmaker who has brought us some of the greatest films in all of cinema - no one will ever do it like Martin Scorsese. This film truly showcases why he is considered one of the greatest directors to ever live! It's impeccable!The film is an epic tragedy that is masterfully crafted. It's dark, devastating, and powerful. The film tells a horrific, yet important story that demands to be seen. It's a tragic rumination on greed and power. It's a murder mystery told from the murderers' point of view, packing a nauseating emotional punch thanks to how brazen its conspirators can be about killing a people they deem beneath them - for financial gain, no less - given how much power and political influence is on their side. Scorsese captures, in riveting detail, the sheer arrogance, stupidity, cruelty, and soul-eating evil of white supremacy. Killers of the Flower Moon makes an unsettling companion piece to The Wolf of Wall Street. The American dream at the expense of the easiest victim. And in this case, the business is genocide. Chilling stuff, and Scorsese wisely tones down any theatrics and goes as stark as possible.I feel like when movies are described as ""educational,"" some people tend to look down on them. It makes a movie sound like a ""chore,"" or suggests that it's more concerned with being used as a ""teaching tool"" than with being a ""work of art."" But when I say that Killers of the Flower Moon should be mandatory viewing for everyone, I think it's perhaps some of the highest praise I could ever bestow upon a film - especially since it's because of this specific cast and crew's courageous artistic commitment to this story that it simultaneously holds said educational significance.It's already astonishing that the story of the Osage has been swept under the rug by history as long as it has (if sadly unsurprising), and by telling this tragedy at all, Killers of the Flower Moon instantly asserts itself as important. But the way Scorsese tells it - with profound and unspeakably painful power packed into every scene, and a staggering sense of control over the entirety of the scope and scale of this sprawling story throughout - is what makes this telling significant, and, as of now, the definitive telling as well.And by its sincerely surprising ending - an ending that left me speechless, with a massive lump in my throat - it had transcended beyond its biographical drama trappings to become something else entirely. Something far beyond what most films ever dare to dream of becoming: an essential existential enlightening, and a summation of all the love and loss that could ever possibly comprise one life, with an additional reminder of not just the very real evil that infests every inch of this world, but also a reminder of how we can't afford to ever allow anyone to endure it to this extent - or any extent - again.Scorsese's two most prominent on-screen collaborators, Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, are finally united in one of his films, lending it infinite star power. However, the real revelation here is Lily Gladstone as the wealthy Osage tribeswoman Mollie Burkhart, who falls in love with DiCaprio's chauffeur character, but soon begins to see her family and culture slowly die in front of her. Gladstone turns in a stunning performance that starts out as sweet and powerfully self-assured - but that aura soon slips away as if the life were gradually being drained from her body, and from her eyes. What Lily Gladstone did in Killers of the Flower Moon is astounding - the subtlety of contained emotions (pain, loss, angst all at once) entirely delivered by mimics of the face, it was remarkable to watch. She steals the movie in a film where both DiCaprio and De Niro deliver excellent, potentially career-best performances.The film is brilliantly compelling, and asks tough questions with integrity. It's also delicately crafted, with excellent cinematography, production design, music, and editing. What especially keeps Killers of the Flower Moon interesting despite its epic length is its breakneck momentum, whether through Scorsese's fluid camera movements, editor Thelma Schoonmaker's propulsive cuts, or an expert combination of the two. The subject matter may be somber, but this is a Scorsese movie through and through, with a litany of minor parts played by instantly recognizable actors (like Brendan Fraser and John Lithgow) and scenes of snappy dialogue that make each bit of planning and plotting feel like something out of Goodfellas. It's disarmingly fun, but it also knows exactly how and when to yank you out of comfortable and familiar modes of movie-watching, with stark reminders of the viciousness and bloodthirst lurking just outside the frame (and often inside it, too).The lengthy runtime has the advantage of making something heavy settle in the pit of your stomach for extended periods, not unlike the last hour of Scorsese's The Irishman, in which learning the details of a secret murder plot becomes stressful and harrowing. Only this time, the plan is visible for almost everyone to see - every white character, at least, and the camera is complicit, too - making it even more dread-inducing. It becomes all the more depressing given the ease with which violence is perpetrated against the Osage, even within the confines of supposedly just systems, which seem unlikely to convict white men of these crimes to begin with.I implore you to give this film a chance in theatres. Let yourself experience the powerful tragedy, all the emotions, and really think about what the movie is saying. Then, once it's done, ask yourself: How long will you be complacent with racism? How long will you go along with something and not speak up?It's one of Scorsese's most brutal films, yet one of his most thoughtful and self-reflexive, as he crafts a subversive murder ""mystery"" that leaves no lingering questions save for one. It's a question that defines the tide of American history: Just how far are people willing to go for greed?There's not a single thing about this film that isn't flawless. I was left stunned and speechless. Urgent, unforgettable filmmaking from the first frame to the last. An astonishing, unsettling film. A cinematic masterpiece that will be studied for years to come.A Martin Scorsese Picture.",positive
70,"Killers of the Flower Moon centres around 3 primary characters instead of a single protagonist. They're all interesting but in my opinion, they aren't all layered characters. I gravitated towards Molly Burkhart quickly (this was helped by Lily Gladstone's performance but I'll talk more about that later), she's quiet but strong and takes initiative while others are more content to just suffer through what's ailing the Osage tribe (several things are but a bad case of continual murder and theft are the primary problem). She also tries to see the good in Earnest even when there's so little on display. William Hale is closer, he's playing both sides, pretending to be a friend to the Osage nation yet having his own stake in the game through manipulation and coercion. His true motivations are never in question however and I could have used a little more time with his character's lighter side to perhaps feel some sympathy or understand his side of the story. I wanted to bond with Ernest but his lack of common sense is revealed almost immediately and due to his actions throughout the movie, I never wanted to side with him or was rooting for his success. I think this is all intentional, Flower Moon is a drama and ultimately a tragedy so this always how this story was going to unfold (you also have a duty to tell the story how it actually happened... instead of taking the American Hustle route). But even if that's the intention, you can't blame the audience for refusing to invest in all 3 of the protagonists and instead only empathizing with the one of main characters. This in turn will limit how much I engage with the movie because if the movie is predominantly being led by characters who are unsympathetic scumbags, why should I do anything but root for them to get their just deserts? This is so drawn out in the movie's laborious runtime that it dampened the enjoyment I got from the retribution, but more on that later.Killers of the Flower Moon was hyped up with featuring 3 Oscar calibre performances. I would say Gladstone is worthy of that consideration and De Niro is close. I have to give Lily all the credit in the world, this is the biggest stage with some of the most talented people in their respective fields and she shone the brightest. She was a great casting choice and she fits this part like a glove. I had some problems with William Hale's characterization but De Niro hits all the right notes. He's affable when he needs to be, sinister when it requires and icy cold by the end. Scorsese-De Niro pairings have led to some legendary films and it's obvious to anyone that has seen any of those movies, they're a perfect match and they create special stuff together. I'm probably going to be in the minority here but I think Leonardo DiCaprio is miscast in Killers of the Flower Moon. His character is supposed to be an every man nitwit who is easily manipulated and he just doesn't fit as the yokel type. He's a great actor and I understand why Scorsese cast him but I would have gone another direction. The supporting cast is stacked but my favourite was newcomer Tommy Schultz as flunky Blackie Thompson who's darkly comedic in how blunt his delivery is. Killers needs a little levity here and there and he made me laugh with how resigned his character is to just doing everyone else's dirty work.The trailers for Killers of the Flower Moon should have been advertising it as a Best Picture nominee (we all know it will be) and you expect a lavish production when you're stepping into the theatre. Killers definitely delivers on that front. The sets look fantastic, the attention to detail is great and it helps you absorb the world these people are experiencing. The cinematography is fantastic and the production design is top shelf. You can tell this movie was well funded and they used their giant budget effectively.I was prepared stepping into Killers of the Flower Moon for it to be long but just like previous Scorsese flick The Irishman, even knowing ahead of time might not prepare you for how LONG this movie is. Conversely to the Irishman, this movie had a lot of fat to be trimmed off here. This is a good film but holy cow is there a lot of dead air in Killers. The story is fairly straightforward, there aren't many unexpected twists or turns to accommodate so the scenes of trickery and deceit all meld together. You have to take the movie how it is but I do think there was a more compact version of this movie that would have been more palatable.I wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did and I'm a little disappointed I didn't enjoy it more. This movie will be remembered fondly by most of the critical population and I feel like a killjoy. Killers of the Flower Moon is beautiful and has all the trappings of what should be the premier movie release of the year. But I liked it as opposed to loving it and I do feel like I won't be the only one who feels this way. I'd still recommend checking out Killers if you're intrigued but in terms of quality, I think you can wait for streaming.",positive
71,"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",positive
72,"I've rated this 8/10 because of the quality of the acting and the importance of the history this movie is based upon.It appears though, that Scorsese, due to his previous body of work, has reached a point where people around him may be afraid to speak up particularly when it comes to editing.Whilst beautiful to look at in many scenes, the movie is anywhere up to an hour too long for the events portrayed.As an example, without giving too much away, there is a scene which involves fire and the same shot of human silhouettes against the backdrop of the fire is shown several times when once would've been enough to convey the imagery.It remains a movie worth seeing, but the editing staff around the Director should have been more upfront with him and shortened or cut several scenes which fail to move the story forward.",positive
73,"Great film. Not sure how I want to describe it after that. It's a brutal story, but Scorsese doesn't dwell on the brutality side - he focuses on how the brutality affects the characters. In particular, It focuses on Lily Gladstone and how she deals as her family is slowly killed off. There really isn't any gore or gruesomeness in the film. The worst scenes have been in the previews so if you've seen the previews, that's what you will see in the film.This is pretty much a Gladstone movie: she is not a supporting player by any means. DiCaprio is good as the catalyst to keep the story action moving. He's used as the pawn in DeNiro's clever game to get the oil fields from the Indians. His makeup is subtle but convey his sliminess. DeNiro, when he does drama like this, always does a tremendous job in the role: it's a ""Trumpian"" type role when he manipulates you to do the job, then he makes sure you're the fall-guy for the issue. It's a well made film that tells a fascinating story. All technicals are top rate.The only issue I had was with the ending: not a bad thing/not a good thing -> just something I wasn't expecting and i'm not going to tell you what it was - only that I had never seen that type of resolution before and, in hindsight, it was a pretty nifty way to wrap the story.Can't wait to see it again when it comes to AppleTV.",positive
74,"This movie was at least 1 hour, maybe 1.5 hours, too long. While I loved the overall story, I didn't like the screenplay and script much. There were too many unnecessary scenes, that stretch out for way too long, while other bits and pieces that would have made the story more cohesive we're completely missing. Most characters were very one dimensional - be it pure evil, naive or powerless.While I appreciate the story, the acting, the visuals the most part the soundtrack, ultimately it ended up being a very forgettable movie. In retrospective, staying at home and watching anything on Netflix would have been more enjoyable.",positive
75,"I wouldn't enjoy watching this movie in a theater due to its 3.5-hour runtime, which seems excessive for a film without much action or tension. However, when I watch it in 40-minute segments, it becomes more engaging as I witness the tragic story unfold gradually.Excellent actors, cinematography, and direction, but I believe a 120-minute runtime would have been more suitable for a compelling movie experience. Scorsese likely wanted to take his time with this project, similar to his previous work. Despite my reservations, I appreciate the effort put into the film.Observing a group display such a profound disregard for human life is sadly unsurprising. It seems that nothing has changed, and perhaps nothing ever will.",positive
76,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a film that showcases some remarkable talent, particularly with a strong cast and an impressive performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. However, the journey to the heart of the story feels like a road. The main issue lies in the prologue, which lingers a bit too long, testing the patience of the audience.The film does have its moments, with cinematography that captures the beauty of the landscape and the historical setting. The attention to detail is evident, and the dedication to recreating a bygone era is commendable. It's a treat to see such a talented ensemble cast bring these characters to life, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.Nevertheless, the slow start and prolonged setup can make it challenging to become fully engaged in the story. The pacing could have been more efficient, as the audience may find themselves waiting for the plot to gain momentum.That said, the message conveyed in ""Killer of the Flower Moon"" remains significant. The film sheds light on a critical part of American history, addressing themes of injustice, racism, and the exploitation of marginalized communities. It's a reminder of the dark chapters in Americas past that still resonate today, making it an important and thought-provoking film.In conclusion, ""Killer of the Flower Moon"" has a strong cast and impressive performances, especially by DiCaprio, but the lengthy prologue and slow pacing are just hard for your concentration. Nevertheless, its message is a powerful one, highlighting the historical injustices.",positive
77,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by the great master Martin Scorsese and is based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Great actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, play a role in this piece and there acting again touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history. I must say that I am always enchanted by Leonardo Di Caprio's acting and every time I forget that Leonardo Di Caprio is acting instead of living the role, and this time it was no different.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth does not only bring good but thanks to white businessmen who ones again are looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible, it also brings bad. The story hides in a way a lot's of lessons but one must want to see..I am very sparing in giving high scores, but this film well deserved it.I won't praise the actors too much, with such a budget you can get the best actors, but they really contribute. For me it is mainly the theme, storyline and the progressiveness of Martin Scorsese that mainly influences my high score. I hope that many will follow and these people will be honored in their losses.",positive
78,We all can agree Master Scorsese can do what he wants at this point and he definitely does with his new yet again near four hour attempt at an Epic Tale. Unfortunately that doesn't mean it yields groundbreaking results or withstanding impressions like his past films of his prime. This film much like his last The Irishman is chalk full of brilliant actors and dialogue something that's usual for his films. Leo is always delivering an Oscar worthy performance. Where this movie can drag lies within its slow as molasses story. I'm not expecting shootouts and incredible heists from a based on true events tale but for the length of near four hours there's only so much talking and staring that can be withstood. While it most likely depicts what it needs to it could be cut in half and be more effective that way. The scenery is magnificent and the overall visuals are immense and worth the watch alone. The bottom line is that it's clear Scorsese wants to film talking more than anything which is fine for 2 hours but a bit winded at 4.,positive
79,"I remember when I first heard that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' was going to be 3 and a half hours long thinking what a slog it's going to be to get through. Some director's films are trending longer and longer and Martin Scorsese is certainly one of them. However, it doesn't necessarily have to be a death sentence for a film and as it turns out this was one of the rare exceptions where it was justified. I had a good time with this film.Even though the film is very long, the story feels like it was demanding it to fit everything in. Very few scenes in the movie feel gratuitous. It's an epic tale and it needed to be told in the right way. The film also keeps its momentum going. It never feels like it falls into a lull at any stage.It does help that the film has an amazing cast to carry every scene. There really are some captivating performances here and then towards the end there are some unexpected cameos which were an absolute treat.I really didn't know what to expect with this film going in. The full spectrum was on the cards. I could've hated every minute of it, right through to it being one of my favourite films of the year. And everything in between. Not many films have that kind possibility going in. It probably won't crack my top 10 for 2023, but it wasn't far off. 8.5/10.",positive
80,"For the first time I am seeing Leonardo Decaprio play the role of a character who is somewhat dim witted - not his usual sharp smart personality. But he played it beautifully.Other characters were good but some of the acting of the side character didn't feel on point.The story is a good one, worth watching but it feels like it centers around one family only. I hoped for a much broader picture that includes many cases of many families and overall situations and crimes against the osage people as a whole.The story is not told on an epic scale but rather it shows just one case. There should've been more back story and other incidents. This is the only thing I didn't like, other then that everything else is mama Mia.",positive
81,"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",positive
82,"The importance of addressing (and attempting to correct) gross injustices can't be overemphasized, and that's the key objective behind writer-director Martin Scorsese's latest release. This fact-based saga chronicles attempts by unscrupulous, two-faced White swindlers clandestinely (and sometimes quite brazenly) seeking to steal the considerable assets of wealthy Osage Indians in Oklahoma in the 1920s after oil is discovered on their land. This tragic tale explores the depths that these immoral criminals would go to (including murder) in the name of unabashed greed, efforts ironically spearheaded by the local, smiling, allegedly well-meaning sheriff (Robert DeNiro) with the help of his dimwitted nephew (Leonardo DiCaprio), especially in their scheme to shamelessly pilfer the wealth of the accomplice's own wife (Lily Gladstone). The sweeping scope of this offering is indeed impressive, effectively brought to life by the fine performances of the three principals and an excellent ensemble of supporting players. And the stellar cast is backed by proficiently executed work in an array of technical areas, including production design, writing, cinematography and the original background score, making for a gorgeous picture to look at, all of which have earned ""Flower Moon"" a boatload of awards season nominations, with more undoubtedly to follow. However, the runtime of 3:26:00 - with no intermission - is a challenge to manage, even for the most patient and tolerant moviegoer. I streamed it, watching it in two parts, almost as if it were more of a TV miniseries than a standalone film, the only way I could effectively see myself getting through it. This handling of the story, in my opinion, represents something of a significant miscalculation by the filmmaker and the film editing staff - either cut the picture (which could have been done without losing much) or add a much-needed break partway through (which could have been accomplished without inhibiting the story's continuity). In my view, I believe that the second half was far better and more compelling than the first and that some of the narrative's more incidental detail could have easily been dispensed with without affecting the overall quality of the release. Still, that aside, it's obvious that this project was a labor of love for the director, one with a clear vision of what it wanted to say in relating an important and little-known story of injustice in a nation that professes to be a staunch champion of truth and virtue, and, for that, we should be thankful for the enlightenment provided here. This unconventional take on the Western may not feature the traditional cinematic interpretation of cowboys and Indians, but it nevertheless sets the record straight about who the real villains are, at least in this story, a lesson from which we can all learn.",positive
83,"I went into watching this movie, blind, meaning, I did not know it was based on real events. Eventually, I caught onto the truth midway through which only served to intensify the horror of what I was watching. The movie paints both the beauty of love, perhaps even flawed loved, and the evil of humanity, with the focus on the latter.The acting was so stellar that it felt like I was invading the private lives of real people. The last 45 minutes of the movie had me on the edge of my seat from intense curiosity, desire for some much need to comeuppance, and for absolute closure.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn about some forgotten history, told in a brilliant way by Scorsese.",positive
84,"This film is too long... sadly. It doesn't make you think too much which is a shame, it's too obvious and there is no mystery. From the outset you are cleared up on the evil and cunning details of De Niro's plan so therefore you are to sit helplessly for 3 hours whilst watching Osage people being murdered mercilessly without the murderers facing consequences. Now of course one assumes this is the history and how the story unravelled in real life however there is teaching modern day people of important storys in history and then there's hi expecting cinema goers to sit through 3 hours of unrelenting murder.The acting lacked in the first half but the second half exceeded my expectations, De Niro was better than expected, DiCaprio had an exhilarating final 20 minutes and Lily Gladstone's acting was excellent however subtle at times yet still superb throughout. Gladstone's portrayal of a character with 'wise eyes' was the most authentic and scintillating I have seen in either a male or female character in cinema.Could've been so much more but was still worth seeing if you love films and love cinema. The colour and costumes were very good and set design/locations were pleasing.",positive
85,"I'll spare you a rundown of the plot as I encourage you to watch the film for yourself. I'd like to start off with some pros; the acting, the set pieces, the supporting cast. Now we'll address the cons, and there are many.For as serious as the subject at hand is, the random moments of comic relief felt off and out of place but not too distracting. The handling of the plot was a bit disjointed. While there were talks about oil, and a random scene of the oil workers themselves, that subject is often neglected. Given the summary for this film on here mentions this, I assure you it isn't talked much upon all too much.The film focuses heavily on insurance and the price of greed. But the way in which the random murders occurred for what reasons you could make out, it felt a bit too scrambled to truly grasp the connections for it to give a solid impact. Yes it was one murder after another, but the murders themselves weren't meticulously displayed with the proper impact. They were shallow and short lived.While I take it it was done with intent, Ernest was insufferable. Also from the jump, his uncle showed his true colors from the first time they got to sit and talk with one another. The audience was in on the whole thing from the jump which led to no ""Ah ha!"" moments, or moments of exciting revelations. You just have to sit with knowing every time these individuals were on screen, they only saw people as money.Which then leads me to my next gripe with the film. The relationship between Ernest and Mollie felt somewhat genuine, the fact that Mollie never once suspected anything is just too good to be true. The fact that you watch Ernest doing all these despicable stuff and then are suppose to believe that he loves his wife with all of his heart is a big ask. Divorce was inevitable and deserved. If the intent was to never like the main character then the film accomplished just that.I'll end it with this, the ending was terrible. I understand the artistic side of things and I am all for that, but not with this film. We deserved to see those individuals get sentenced to life. We deserved to watch Mollie divorce Ernest. Mollie deserved to have her death shown with grace rather than a halfhearted obituary for the sake of art. The pacing of the film was done quite well and for it being over 3 hours it didn't quite feel like it. I would've respected the film a lot more had those things happened than the ended we got.",positive
86,"You may like some of Scorsese's films more or less, but there is no debate if we talk about the fact that he is one of the best in the art of film directing.Although for many people The Irishman was a suffering, in my case I enjoyed it very much, despite its length. So there were no worries in my mind when it came to taking on Killers of the Flower Moon.It was absolute cinema. A very well-cared for work from start to finish, brilliantly written and spectacularly filmed. An extremely pleasant journey through a very delicate story to tell, but one that was astutely approached.If I had to highlight something about the film, it would undoubtedly be Lily Gladstone's brilliant performance. A little-known actress but who will undoubtedly be one of the faces of Hollywood from this moment on.206 minutes of cinema, of which I would not cut a single minute.",positive
87,"I was so excited to see this movie because of how captivating the book was. The film was good, but I must agree with others that it was much too long. I don't mind long movies, but I actually started to doze off at one point. Some seriously needed editing might have trimmed it down to a 2 hour 45 minute film.In spite of its length, the movie missed some key elements. It fails to clearly demonstrate how the whole community was ""scalping"" the Osage. I don't think the viewer could understand the vastness of it in the movie. Also left out , was how much the government itself was responsible for what happened. It went from striking oil, to Hale.I also think there should have been so much more on J Edgar Hoover's Tom White. He was the mastermind behind catching Hale, and that part was scooted over with barely any detail, along with the groundbreaking strides made by the FBI. Actually the FBI was barely even mentioned in the movie.If you found the movie interesting, please read the book. It's actually much more shocking!",positive
88,"In early era of cinema filmmakers didn't used to have a big budget, VFX, CGI or any kind of those things which are essential to make modern movies what they had was just a solid story that could be adapted into a good screenplay and some good actors who can act well to keep audience engaged throughout the presentation well this movie honors every thing that represented cinema for a long time in history since early age..Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro don't need any kind of introduction they are the legends of the Hollywood and they are back again in this masterpiece based on a true story that will keep you engaged for 3 hrs and 28 mins.. Yes you read it right, film is too long but if you truely love cinema you'll never feel bored even for a second throughout entire run. The film is based on the murder of Indians during early 1920s commited by some greedy white Americans to steal their lands and since it is a real story it didn't have many twists and turns, sometimes it becomes predictable but belive me peak acting by main leads and a gripping screenplay featuring dramatic scenes with some great dialouges will keep you engaging.. I read somewhere that this film is only for older audience and will not be enjoyed by modern audience mainly because of its runtime and it'll tell you it's completely false until you are one of those new kid who only enjoys action and superhero stuff. As a 22 yr old myself I always enjoy longer drama movies since I love cinema too much I've also loved The Irishmen in 2019 and always look out for more movies like these..
Overall I loved entire second of it and if you also a cinema lover like me don't miss this one, it's nothing very special since its based on a book which was also based on real events but trio of MS, LDC and RDN made it great.. Watch it for great acting and as a solid thriller drama you'll enjoy it..",positive
89,"I enjoyed the book, in part I think because there were no big name Hollywood types associated with any of the characters. I had the opportunity to determine who were the villains and who were the heroes.The movie on the other hand is skewed with the villains (DeNiro and DiCaprio) consuming most of the 3.5 hours of screen time and dialogue. The heroes (Gladstone and Plemons) seem to get short shrift and the Osage people seem there to add credibility not character.The movie would have benefited from an intermission, some thoughtful editing and less catering to the apparent egos of the headliners.7 stars is generous!!",positive
90,"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",positive
91,"Let me preface my review with this: I'm a fan of history, I'm 1/2 Cherokee and Love the films of Scorcese, DiCaprio , and Dinero.This movie I'll rate in 2 parts. The first 1 1/2 and the last 2 hrs. Part 1 a 7. Part 2 a 9. For the love love of us that still go to the movies and those that invest in them, either bring back the Intermission or trim some fat to save for the directors cut release.Without a doubt 30-45 minutes could've been trimmed from the 1st half. It created the mood, planted seeds for the 2nd half, but definitely too long.There were only 24 people in the theater. Half of those like myself were there alone.I'm sure more people would view if this and other epics were shorter or there was an intermission. I'm sure the theater operators would appreciate the additional concessions revenue.",positive
92,"In ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" director Martin Scorsese takes us on a roller-coaster ride through the flower-blooming, oil-oozing fields of Oklahoma, blending historical drama with a tinge of dark humor. This isn't your typical Scorsese mob flick, but it's got enough intrigue and family betrayal to make Vito Corleone blush.The film's opening sequence, where Osage Nation elders bury a ceremonial pipe, sets a somber tone, but don't be fooled. As we dive into the story of Ernest Burkhart, played by Leonardo DiCaprio with the usual flair but surprisingly more mustache-twirling villainy than expected, we're treated to a saga that's part history lesson, part soap opera. The narrative unfolds with the subtlety of a gusher, splashing riches and misfortune in equal measure. There's something darkly comedic about DiCaprio's earnest Ernest trying to navigate the complexities of Osage law, love, and oil - all while wearing a hat that seems to have a life of its own.Scorsese's portrayal of William King Hale as a cowboy-hat-wearing, cattle-ranching, back-stabbing villain is so over-the-top, it's almost a caricature. Robert De Niro's Hale struts around the reservation with a swagger that screams ""I'm the bad guy,"" yet everyone seems blissfully unaware. The film's highlight is a scene where De Niro and DiCaprio discuss murder plans over a game of checkers, while casually swatting away the flies of moral conscience. The dialogue here is so on the nose, it's almost as if Scorsese is winking at the audience, saying, ""Yes, I know what I'm doing.""But where ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" truly shines is in its portrayal of the Osage community. The film doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of their exploitation and suffering, yet there's an undercurrent of resilience and dark humor in their struggle. The scenes of the Osage council plotting their comeback could give ""Game of Thrones"" a run for its money - if only they had dragons.In conclusion, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a historical epic that unexpectedly doubles as a dark comedy. It's like if ""There Will Be Blood"" met ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" at a family reunion and decided to make a movie about oil, murder, and cowboy hats. Scorsese delivers a visually stunning, narratively complex film that will make you laugh, cry, and perhaps check your insulin. Just remember, in the world of Osage oil, trust no one, especially not a man in a cowboy hat.",positive
93,"The plot is much too simple and straightforward. The screenplay is not good enough to justify the 3.5 hour length and it causes the film to feel extremely long. The run time is not earned. There is so litttle going on from moment to moment I think even if you left and came back 20 minutes later you will not have missed a thing. It is especially hard to keep track of the characters given how quickly they are introduced and killed off from scene to scene. The murders I think were glossed over much too easily, and kind of clumsily executed. There were numerous chuckles here and there through the film during my showing, and that just isn't the kind of atmosphere a movie like this should be conveying. It is supposed to make you feel horrified and uncomfortable. Not to mention the ending was abrupt and very weak. Acting was superb, and movie had an important message to tell. Overall it was serviceable, but no masterpiece.",positive
94,"Killers of the flower Moon was a brilliant telling of a severely over looked part of american history, the story does not stray to tell the gory and disturbing things that people did to others to gain money from oil, As always the movie may have been long but i was captivated for every minute of it, people may complain about the long silences and the 'unnecessary' close in on looks given by Ernest and other characters but really they were necessary to portray the mood of the characters.Another role played brilliantly by DiCaprio no doubt, he does well to portray his character (ernest) He shows just how much Ernest trusted but also feared his uncle to go to the extent in which he did at his uncles will, he was even going to go to jail for the man despite realising just what he had done and how much of a fraud he was saying he 'cared' cared for the people when in reality it was him killing them off for their money and oil claims.Overall i believe this was a very well done movie, well paced and with brilliant actors and writing, Scorsese had pulled it off again.",positive
95,"Essentially you can't fault anything about this movie, except the pace. The story was amazing and needing to be told , incredible cast with incredible acting , incredible director , incredible visuals but the first two acts were like not just slow but excruciating. Needed 45 minutes out and would have then become an all time classic, but who is going to tell Scorsese to get back in the edit and clean up the soggy edit ? There is so much good about this movie it's a real shame pace became such a problem. There is simply no need for it to be this long. I will rewatch, but I spent a large portion of my time in cinema looking at my watch thinking wow we have another two plus hours of this , how am I going to make it ? This comes from a HUGE Scorsese fan going in wanting to love this movie. Final act bought it together but needed to have done so much sooner . All in my humble opinion of course . The trailer shows a very different movie.",positive
96,"A stunning exploration of the banality of evil centers on Ernest Burkhart, played brilliantly and powerfully by DiCaprio. Sometimes I blinked and saw not an actor, but a real criminal from black and white photographs of the century before last - limited, evil, greedy, with the face of degradation. And most importantly, he is a master at lying to himself.This is amazing - how can you feel good while killing your wife's relatives, the mother of your children? How can you believe that you are a loving husband (he believes, that's what's amazing!) when you inject your wife with a drug that clearly makes her worse. I had a strange association that Ernest, as if under a magnifying glass, showed the same effect of a split psyche as the population of totalitarian aggressor countries, whose population also convinced and continues to convince themselves of their innocence. That evil manifested with their consent is the will of God (or the leader, or the will of the uncle) - and I am actually not a monster (approving genocide, committing bloodshed), not a murderer, I am good. I take care of my wife. I injected her with poison and then carefully combed her hair...
DiCaprio and Scorsese brilliantly embodied this character. It's a banality of evil that's impossible to believe and that sucks Molly in like sticky swamp mud.But I admit, I couldn't watch the movie without interruption. I needed a drink, a snack and just to get up. Although the direction and cinematography are beautiful and I didn't get bored, it was physically difficult for me to spend so much time sitting in front of the screen. As a book publishing editor, I know that authors are against abbreviations - they worked a lot on the text. But often the book (film) only benefits from this.",positive
97,"The good thing about this movie it's telling the truth about land and people which their fortune are stealing by greediness and with government approval, however the movie lacks the tension and if you like napped for half hour you won't miss anything, the movie could be one and half hour max without missing anything from the 3 and half hour.During the movie you will always have feeling okay it's gonna be interesting here, but it will never come.And i feel that most of people aren't thinking a bit to discover things, Molly and Ernest they can't see what's planning at all or they suspect anyone.The acting of the Gladstone was the best part here.",positive
98,"Keeping the theme of time....... Some people can't handle a 3-hour and 27-minute movie. However, *chefs kissed* because this is detailed storytelling. After sitting and thinking about the story for a full day, I don't think anything could have been taken out. There is a build-up to each character where you as the audience are invested in their personal story. Whether you are waiting for their demise or triumph. The acting is absolutely Oscar-worthy. Leo, Lily, and Robert owned every scene they were in and I truly hope they receive their flowers come award season.(MOP) Yeah, the movie is long but what great movies aren't? *cough* gone with the wind *cough* End Game*. This story about Native tragedy was depicted beautifully and is one that world needs to see.",positive
99,"As a long time admirer of Martin Scorsese, this film promised so much, but apart from the running time, delivered less than the promise.The premise of the story was good, and the acting excellent, but the pace was slow and the film could do with some judicious trimming in the editing suite. Some scenes were overlong and others such as the autopsy scene were jarring and completely unnecessary.It seems like another recent example of a great director who has either forgotten the need to tell a tale concisely, or that has no-one around them to have a quiet word, rather than just agreeing and admiring the master.Look forward to seeing the 'non-Directors Cut' of the film to experience what could have been.",positive
100,"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",positive
101,"Even though I never heard of this story before, I think this movie is enjoyable. I went through every pace with joy, although the film had very long durations. I like every detail, storyline, intricts, and especially the Indian's life. But, I don't think that this film is for everyone. I was just watching this film at a cinema near me, but the audiences are only 8 of a hundreds seats. There was only me as an early 20s guy, and the rest were adults maybe 40s or 50s and sometimes playing on their phones, not watching this film entirely. The last thing is I think the storyline is predictable enough that I can assume its ending from the beginning although not 100% right. Hence, overall it's all great enough.",positive
102,"Killers Of The Flower Moon is wonderful. Martin Scorsese's output recently has been terrific and he is on fine form here as well, showcasing his ability to take his time with the story while racking up the suspense to a neat finale.Seeing Robert De Niro & Leonardo DiCaprio share a screen is great and they are given many scenes together and ignite the screen with their chemistry. De Niro has a much bigger role than i expected and it will be funny seeing him up for Supporting Actor when he has more screen time than most lead actors will have this year.Just as the film is starting to feel it's length, Jesse Plemons appears and breathes new life into it. Plemons is a great actor and deserves the best roles possible, as a character actor he may be the best around since Philip Seymour Hoffman.The storytelling is sensational and Scorsese handles the violence in his typical strong way. Likewise, typical Scorsese, the score for the film is spectacular and Robbie Robertson deserves a lot of praise for the success of the film as the music is vital to the piece.Lily Gladstone is new to me and she is wonderful here as Mollie Burkhart. Gladstone has the hardest job here managing to convey so many emotions throughout the film. An Oscar Nomination could well be in her future and she would be fully deserving.Killers Of The Flower Moon is a triumph and continues to show that Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest film directors of all time.",positive
103,"First thing - this is by no means a BAD movie. But giving it a 6/10 after being bored through 75% of it seems generous. However, I'll stick with it for the gorgeous cinematography, and great acting. That earns an 8/10, while the story that was told is about a 4/10.For the love of god, someone reel in Martin Scorsese. The Irishman was 60-90 minutes too long, was a bit boring, but at least kept me interested through a good portion of it. Killers of the Flower moon had me looking at my watch and saying ""my god, we still have two hours.""Major point of feedback is this took way too long to get going. It was about 80% setup which was done poorly with too much empty dialogue, boring conversation, and below average character development. It was the only Leo movie where I completely struggled to get interested in his character. The last 20% of the film was the FBI getting involved and investigating the situation surrounding Ernest (Leo) and Hale (DeNiro). In my opinion, the film would've been significantly more interesting if it was closer to an even split. It wasn't until I left the theatre and did some reading on my own that I realized just how truly horrific this story was, and the lack of real criminal investigation being shown was the reason this was failed to be hammered home. It happened in the end, but by that point, I was just glad to leave.Scorsese - go back to 2-2.5 hour films.",positive
104,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a screenplay developed by Martin Scorsese, Eric Roth and David Grann from his book of the same name.This movie is based on shockingly true events that occurred early last century in the good ol' US of A.A series of murders of wealthy First Nations Osage people took place in Osage County, Oklahoma.It all came about in the early 1920s, after big oil deposits were discovered beneath their land.After the Osage people were awarded the rights to the profits made from those deposits, they prepared to receive the wealth to which they were legally entitled and became hugely rich beyond anyones wildest dreams.A complex plot was hatched to eliminate the Osage inheritors on a one-by-one basis by any means possible.White men (Coyotes) married into the these rich Osage families with one intent to get all the oil money for themselves.Officially, the number of victims reached at least twenty, but more could be undocumented.Martin Scorsese read David Grann's book ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" and knew that he had to make it into a movie.Scorsese spent several hours together with Chief Standing Bear to convince the Osage Nation to help with the filming to tell their story which until today had been largely unknown.Although this film is not the first motion picture about the Osage Murders. ""Tragedies of the Osage Hills"" by James Young Deer was released in 1926, nearly a century ago.Later in 1959, films such as The FBI Story likewise depicted the murders.Watch out for: Lily Gladstone as ""Mollie"" just perfect for this role.Sad Fact: ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is the last movie of actor Larry Sellers.Of Osage and Cherokee descent, Larry was also an Osage language instructor.Fun Fact: This is the seventh film collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio.It also marks the eleventh collaboration between Scorsese and Robert De Niro.This is also the fourth time De Niro and DiCaprio have appeared in a film (short or feature length) together.However, this is the first time that Scorsese, De Niro and DiCaprio will have all collaborated together on a feature film.Robbie Robertson's (ex- The Band, Bob Dylans group) wrote his final film score for ""Killers of the Flower Moon"".He died two months before the film's general release and ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is dedicated to his memory.What helps make this movie so powerful is ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is the first time that Scorsese, De Niro and DiCaprio have all collaborated together on a feature film.Somehow Leo transforms his face in this movie without prosthetics to look more like a young De Niro.De Niro himself is finally back in fine form after a series of low grade comedies that only propped up his Superannuation and did nothing for his legacy.The wonderful Jesse Plemons only comes into the movie in the third act as a FBI agent, ""Tom White"".Brendan Fraser and John Lithgow have small but solid roles at the backend of ""Killers of the Flower Moon"".There will be many award nominations and wins for ""Killers of the Flower Moon"".Granted it was filmed on $200 million dollar budget making it one of the most expensive biopics ever made in Hollywood, but you can see where every dime has been spent on marquee actors, director, sets, props, costumes etc
This is a must see movie, don't let the movies length deter you, because my eyes never left the screen and I never looked at my smart watch or phone once.Grab a ticket for ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" in Gold Class/Lounge whatever, get real comfy order lots of food and drink and enjoy this faultless movie that's not so much a whodunit, but a who-didn't-do-it.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is the ""Citizen Kane"" for this century.",positive
105,"Despite good acting, direction, and cinematography, watching this incredibly difficult story about sociopaths and their victims will shrink your brain. When you finally leave the cinema, there's nothing worth remembering but true horror.I don't even understand why the FBI is portrayed so positively, and the movie somehow passively glorifies the state, which was capable of quickly recognizing true evil and sorting out the community issue, while the native people were completely clueless.Truly awful. I never want to watch it again, as this is no longer entertainment but rather a sort of traumatic exercise.",positive
106,"I've never written a review before, but as an avid movie fan who was astounded by this movie, I felt like this is a good one to start with.First off, the story is incredible, not only the screenplay, but the fact that this is based on actual events adds a whole new level to the impact it had on me as a viewer. The acting is incredible, DiCaprio, De Niro, Plemons are all as good as expected along with the rest of the supporting cast from the dude who stole the car (can't remember his name) to Brendan Fraser's brief appearance towards the end of the film. Lily Gladstone stole the show in my opinion and if it were up to me, she already have an Oscar for her performance. She truly makes you feel the emotion of the Osage throughout the entirety of the film.The cinematography and score are as fantastic as can be expected from Scorsese. It really does feel like we are watching life in the 1920s between the accurate vehicles, set design and even references to real world events taking place at the same time as the Osage murders. Not to mention the black and white shots throughout the film that transcend us into viewing what appears to be old footage of the Osage.Also, the fact that a lot of it was filmed in Oklahoma with the help of the Osage tribe seems to have benefitted everything about the film. Their amazing culture and lifestyle seemed to be represented appropriately while mixing it with the story that is being told.Overall, this is probably my movie of the year, edging out Oppenheimer and Barbie. It seems like one of the few movies in recent years that the creators are really trying to tell a story rather than make a quick buck.",positive
107,"Killers of the Flower Moon"", directed by Martin Scorsese, is a cinematic work that shines with its extraordinary direction and breathtaking cinematography. Scorsese, known for his distinctive style, offers a magnificent vision of the American past through a series of unforgettable shots. Despite its merits, the film suffers due to its length and lack of plot twists. With a slow-moving plot, the film may be long-winded for some viewers. The lack of surprises or twists makes the narrative predictable, and you can guess the direction of the story from the first part of the film. Furthermore, Leonardo DiCaprio, although a very talented actor, is relegated to playing a character who appears lacking in personality and intelligence, almost a puppet in the hands of Robert De Niro's character. This aspect was disappointing, considering the potential of both actors. From the hands of a director of the caliber of Martin Scorsese, known for giving us unforgettable masterpieces such as 'Shutter Island', 'The Departed' and 'Gangs of New York', I would have expected greater tension and involvement in 'Killers of the Flower Moon' ' '. Unfortunately, the film fails to capture the viewer's attention as convincingly as his previous works, despite solid performances from the cast, including that of Leonardo DiCaprio. The lack of tension and surprises, coupled with a predictable plot, could leave audiences with a feeling of untapped opportunities. Ultimately, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is like an unexploded bomb.",positive
108,"I'll be perfectly honest and say that even though The Irishman was an incredibly well-made film, being nearly four hours and only available on Netflix really made it a chore to watch. I really like that film, but I wished it was on the big screen with maybe an intermission. With that said, the pacing issues I had with that film made me worried about Martin Scorsese's next film Killers of the Flower Moon. Sitting in a theatre for three and a half hours with no breaks is something I haven't done in many years and it just felt like a daunting task. Well, I'll admit when I'm being ridiculous and I absolutely was. Not only does this film barely feel its length, but I wasn't bored for a second. This is a film that utilizes every minute of its screen time perfectly. Killers of the Flower Moon blew me away and here's why.Based on the true events in the 1920s, Killers of the Flower Moon takes place in Oklahoma, as the Hale family rules the land of the Osage tribe. As members of their tribe begin to be killed off one by one, investigators come to town to get to the bottom of it. Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is the nephew of William Hale (Robert De Niro), marries into the wealthiest family in the Osage tribe. His wife, Mollie Burkhart (Lily Gladstone), happens to be on the receiving end of many of these deaths. For those of you who don't know the true story, I'll just leave it at that but say that the main characters of this film are the true villains of the story. That alone made this a hard watch, but it's so impeccably made that I couldn't look away.Martin Scorsese, in my opinion, has made one of his best films in decades. I haven't loved one of his films quite this much since I experienced Hugo back in 2011. Let me be clear though, this isn't a film that I can say I enjoyed in an entertaining way or anything like that, but I just sat back and appreciated the filmmaking being done, along with this very important, dark story that I wasn't entirely aware of (in terms of the details). It may be a tough pill to swallow for some viewers, but this had me completely engaged from start to finish. In a depressing and dark way, this film defines the word epic.There aren't a lot of people to root for in this story, but Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, as always, command every scene they're in. Everyone has also been talking about how incredible Lily Gladstone is and for very good reason, I won't be surprised at all if she gets a lot of awards love in the coming months. Her performance here was simply remarkable. Accenting the performances and beautiful camerawork was also the score by Robbie Robertson. From pulse-pounding moments to intimate moments with hardly any music at all, Robertson's final piece of work (since he passed away after completing this) is wonderful.Killers of the Flower Moon is a three-and-a-half-hour film that never feels its length. Yes, since it's so long, your body may feel it, but again, it was impossible to feel bored. The subject matter being displayed was just too important for me to look away from. This film took me on a journey and I left in awe. It may just be my favourite film of the year so far. I sadly don't think it will find a wide audience, but I implore those who are interested, to please see it in a theatre. I'm very happy that I did. Filmmaking at its finest.",positive
109,"I never leave reviews and this movie wasn't bad and I liked it but I made the mistake of seeing it in theaters. It's FOUR hours long so I had to get up half way through to stretch and walk around. I saw Oppenheimer and didn't have that problem but this is a lot slower than Oppenheimer. I most likely will never watch this movie again and recommend renting it instead of the movie theaters. My friend claimed it was Leo decaprios best movie so I agreed to go but i wouldn't even put it in his top ten. Also, I love the actress lead because she's from billions and does hopefully get an Oscar for this.",positive
110,"I wonder what score this movie would get if people didn't know it was directed by Scorsese. What would one think without that knowledge?Probably that this was done by an ambitious, very young, albeit not too talented guy/gal fresh out of film school who wanted to show the universe of knowledge they have about moviemaking. This then predictably ends up in an overly long, dabbling, shallow production that drowns in its own point. Also proof that even great actors need to be given well-written lines and directed - otherwise it just falls apart.I love and respect Martin Scorsese. This makes it all the more difficult for me to understand how he managed to make a movie where the main characters are at best one-dimensional without any kind of depth or improvement. I could even accept this if this shallowness served a purpose, but if it does, it's beyond me. We have the (1) constantly-scheming evil old white guy, (2) the dumb, relatively young white guy who for some reason is ~50 years old and halfway through the movie, starts to contort his face into a bulldog's, and (3) the absolutely braindead Native American lady who doesn't seem to notice/connect how people are dying left and right around her.What is this movie trying to convey? Is it trying to raise sympathy for how Native Americans were taken advantage of? Or just contemplate the simple, stupid evil of human beings? Whatever it is, it quickly turned boring and repetitive enough for me to make it a test of will to watch through and feel no interest, compassion or pity for any characters whatsoever.",positive
111,"As a whole i can still easily say that Killers Of The Flower Moon was a Masterpiece, for 2 hours and 30 minutes the movie kept me intrigued and stuck to the movie the whole time, and while the last hour of the movie dragged a little bit with scene that i don't find boring but more of like fills with sequences that i feel we have enough but never i wanted the movie to be like that's it please end it now, Scorsese's was again in his top of his game at freakin 80 years old, what i see in Killers Of The Flower Moon was some of the best movie directing i've seen from the editing, cinematography, and the best thing was the performances, it's really some of the greatest movie performances i've seen, all cast and even De Niro i believe could have his Oscar nomination in a while for this movie, Screenplay, and definitely Best Picture, it is also one of the best true story ever adapted to a movie, Killers Of The Flower Moon felt absolutely complete, once you in the story you can't think about anything else and that's how i feel throughout the film, it is incredible, it's a movie and a true story that i wish have the same amount of interest as Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, and i can tell personally that Killers Of The Flower Moon was a better movie than Oppenheimer, all praise for the film and although i wish to give it a perfect score again there is a moment that i wish the movie stops so it can be perfect but the last hour was filled by couple or more scene that i think we have enough, there is not a lot of real cinema film that came out in theaters for a long time and if you looking for one this movie was the one, overall Killers Of The Flower Moon was another Masterpiece from the master of cinema himself Martin Scorsese, and it's quite an experience, epic in a way, one of the best films of the year simply.",positive
112,"Before seeing the film, I felt it was going to be too long, but I only glanced at my watch once. I found it totally engrossing. It must be one of the best films made in the last 50 years. The trailers had given me the impression that it would be full of violence and gratuitous explosions, like an enormous number of films aimed at teenage audiences, but it turned out to be completely different. It has a few horrific scenes that earn it the 15 rating, but its depth in depicting casual, thoughtless evil alongside slow, treacherous and deliberate evil is what makes it Shakespearean. Nothing in the film is unnecessary. The acting is astonishing. Also, you need to see it on the big screen.",positive
113,"The story has a lot of potential but is told in an unexciting manner because we know everything from the beginning. If told this way, I would expect a change in the protagonist, which is leading to a climax. However, since this doesn't really happen, this storytelling perspective is incredibly dull. Also, of course, due to its long runtime.Lily Gladstone is phenomenal, I think if the story had been told from her perspective and she had been given more screen time, it would have greatly improved... It's a shame. The six stars I give for the actors performance, set and costume design and the quality of production.",positive
114,"It was just a powerhouse of great actors DiCaprio and De Niro gave performances for the ages. Lily Gladstone is very deeply rooted with her character. John Lithgow was very good as was Brendan Fraser. This movie is very spiritually oriented with true emotions and feelings I really connected to this story and characters. This is definitely one of Martin Scorsese best he really made an amazing movie filled with tragedy and emotion. This is a rare film that only comes around a few times, it's amazing in all it's elements. This is one of the best films made in a long time, hopefully it gets nominated.",positive
115,"The build up was good, except nothing really ever happens. Some scenes were good but overall it was kind of long and nothing much happening... De Niro was too obvious. Leo and the actress deserve 10/10. The make up was great n setting too. This movie makes u travel through time. Maybe the timing is just not right for a movie full of deaths. Yeah ok go watch it but I feel there's really something missing. I know this is based on a true story and it's not a Q. T movie but gosh it would have been sooooo satisfying to have a different ending or maybe some action. Some scenes could have been shorter.",positive
116,"By reminding us of the depths of human depravity and juxtaposing it with heroism, compassion and Christ's perpetually outstretched hand of redemption and salvation. KOTFM is a riveting, sobering and powerfully educational watch- educational for the soul. Through Scorcese's unflinching lens we bear witness to the brutal, gut-wrenching wrestling match between predator and prey, between those who will prey upon the vulnerable and those who can only pray because they are vulnerable. Scorsese personally went out of his way to state how important this film was for him to make and I can see why. He wants us to not forget our mistakes, our misdeeds, and to strive for what we can be, should be, as a people, as a country. He wants us to not forget- not to browbeat or shame or humiliate us, but so we don't repeat the same mistakes over and over. Brought to extraordinary life by obviously devoted and dedicated performances, the very real events depicted in KOTFM remain tragic and shocking to this day. Scorsese dutifully set out to make sure it all wasn't in vain.",positive
117,"In well cast, interesting but sad, true 1920's US history tale ""Killers Of The Flower Moon"" the native American Osage tribe (inc Lily Gladstone) strike oil, only to then be exploited for their wealth (to the point of multi-murder) by white devils like Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio & Gene Jones - til Jesse Plemons' FBI team force a trial under lawyers like Brendan Fraser & John Lithgow. Cameos from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Jack White & Pete Yorn add colour but Scorsese's script (written with Eric Roth) is too long at 3.5hrs, and WHY as director did he shoot with minimal cinematography (as if using his iPhone)?! Good movie... but it coulda been so much better.",positive

Cinematography. Every frame was beautiful especially the one in the final scene.Acting: While Gladstone and of course di Caprio were impressive, De Niro was the star.Dialogue and script: I read the book and I'm impressed with what Eric Roth made out it.Soundtrack: this was another positive.Epilogue: I was impressed with this too.Dislikes:
I feel the story should have centred around Mollie. At least that is the way book by David Grann was written. Rather it was centred around Ernest Buckhart. Lily Gladstone should have been the main star of this movie.I also felt it didn't express the tragedy of the story well enough.",positive
119,"As someone who has studied the Osage Murders, I was disappointed at how anticlimactic the movie was compared to the actual historical events.The movie does follow the historical events accurately, just in a tremendously dull way. I sat through 3.5 hours desperately trying not to fall asleep.It was like the producers/ writers wanted to make the movie a love story between DiCaprio and Gladstone which didn't translate.I despised the ending of the movie. I understand the old radio show telling the outcome of each character; however, even that was so dull.I can't express enough how incredibly anticlimactic the movie is as a whole. I expected there to be so much action considering the actual historical events at hand.The acting from De Niro, DiCaprio, and Gladstone is outstanding. Those actors stood out greatly and shined tremendous light on the poor acting of everyone around them.I will not watch this movie twice.",positive
120,"I didn't mind the length. Most of the time with movies I wished they didn't cut so much so that was cool with me. But I didn't like that they told the story from Ernest's POV. Should've been mainly told from Mollie's or the Osage tribe. They would've been great to watch act out the true story & honor the tragedy. Instead it's really kind of honoring the Burkhart men by giving their story so much focus & screentime & it's almost as if giving them a voice when they don't deserve it from all the awful things those men did. They shouldn't have had a voice the Osage should have it or Mollie. I realize that without the star appeal people sadly wouldn't have come out to see it but they could've been in it just the same. The ending wasn't great, just blah.",positive

Based on a true story, this is one of the best movies of the year. Highly recommended.",positive
122,"The fact that this movie doesn't have a score or 8.5 or more tells me all I need to know about today's ""cinephiles"". KoTFM is a great American crime story with incredible directing, storytelling and acting. The movie has no flaws. It never felt rushed and I loved the simplicity of the film. The final act was so creative and brilliant and it's one of the finest things Scorsese has ever done. I hope this movie gets nominated for multiple academy awards. The worst part about watching KoTFM in the theatre was that there were a lot of swifties singing to Taylor's movie and s*** was LOUD af🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣",positive
123,"I love long films: The Green Line, Magnolia, Apocalypse Now, etc. But Killers of the Flower Moon is really long for nothing.Some scenes are redondantes, they exist only to extend the duration of the movie.It deserve a better Cut sadly...Because apart from that, the story is really touching and the film is beautiful. Some passages, particularly towards the end, are real gems.But the film is very predictable (remember Shutter Island?) and the middle of the film is soporific (again, I have no problem with slower, non-action films, provided they manage to captivate the viewer).The film's main quality, comes from the cast.But not the one you'd expect... I wasn't thrilled with DeNiro and Di Caprio, who I love, and who are good of course, but their roles were so predictable, they're on a treadmill.Lily Gladstone, on the other hand, is a gem, as are a good number of the supporting cast (Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Louis Cancelmi, Tatanka Means and Tommy Schultz spring to my mind), all of whom, for me, were THE pleasant surprise of the film.",positive
124,"Killers of the Flower Moon finds Martin Scorsese finally making a Western on his own terms. A sweeping tale of greed, sin and violence that depicts a true story with the sensitivity it deserves. It makes sure to emphasise this wasn't a one off event in American history and ends on a poignant note that turns its attention to the audience directly.Leonardo DiCaprio is the lead here and his performance here is up there with his best roles. Ernest is a conflicted yet clueless person, he clearly loves Mollie but is by no means innocent when it comes to the crimes being committed. People undermine him throughout by calling him boy and it's clear that's because of his lack of control more than his actual age.It's a clever inversion for Robert De Niro to play a character with so much power following his previous Scorsese collaboration as a foot soldier with no self awareness. King Hale is duplicitous to the very end, appearing as an ally to the Osage people whilst plotting to take everything from them. The real terror of his performance is the fear he instils in others is never seen, he appears kind throughout.Lily Gladstone is phenomenal and the main reason for any of this working. Taking the perspective away from the FBI was a brave choice that only works because of how raw her performance is. The pain, the happiness and the strength all feel incredibly real and any scene without her lacks that presence (in ways it's meant to).Martin Scorsese's direction is faultless, he remains a master of the craft. It has urgency from its opening frames, uses that gargantuan run time to show a real odyssey and utilises the huge budget to fill every scene with detail. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is masterful. It definitely doesn't feel its length and there's such a natural rhythm to the scenes.",positive
125,"Killers of the Flower Moon' presents a captivating narrative rooted in historical significance, with commendable performances and attention to detail in production. However, the film's pacing becomes a stumbling block, as scenes linger without purpose, stretching the runtime unnecessarily. While it sheds light on a crucial but overlooked chapter of American history, its lengthy duration and disjointed storytelling detract from its impact. Despite its flaws, the film offers valuable insights into the plight of Native American tribes and the dark underbelly of early 20th-century America. Viewing it requires patience and a willingness to overlook its shortcomings to appreciate its educational and cultural significance.",positive
126,"Scorsese delivers yet another triumph of cinema with a masterful depiction of an intense, emotional and critical time in American history.After hearing that Killers of the Flower Moon was first screened at Cannes film festival back in May of this year, I immediately bought the book (By David Grann) upon which it is based; and I was absolutely hooked.The key difference between the narrative, non-fiction work by Grann, and Scorsese's western epic, is that the lead character changes from Tom White (Jesse Plemons) to Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio). This was a hugely positive decision, as the events that unfolded in Osage county in the 1920s entirely revolved around Ernest and his immediate/in-law family.Arguably the most notable aspect of this films is its monster runtime, standing at 3 hours and 26 minutes (almost half an hour longer than Oppenheimer). However, due to the magnitude of the situation, and sheer emotional struggle presented by our main characters, the time is unbelievably well used and practically flies by.Predicting the Oscars is always difficult, but with Killers of the Flower Moon, I can certainly say that DiCaprio and Gladstone will be nominated. DiCaprio spectacularly shines as Earnest, giving a breathtaking portrayal of a vulnerable, yet dominant man, who's way in over his head.Gladstone truly brings Mollie's grief to life, from her usually serious disposition, to her intense emotional outbursts over the killings, and her agonising illness, an Oscar really ought to come her way.Having been familiar with the story beforehand, I was eager to see my imagined concepts of the landscape, characters, and scenes themselves come to life. And everything from the casting choices, to the filming locations, to the vivid depictions of the murders themselves was perfection. DeNiro in particular is distinctively villainous as William Hale, in his consistent manipulation of Earnest, the members of the Osage, and the Bureau of investigation.In short, Killers of the Flower Moon is a profound, poignant and powerful saga that is arguably the best film of the year.",positive
127,"In ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" Co-writer/Director Martin Scorsese has a lot to say. With the movie clocking in at three hours twenty-six minutes, he has plenty of time to say it.By the 1920's, a mammoth oil deposit had been discovered on the land of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma. Because the tribe had the foresight to explicitly retain the mineral rights to its property, the Osage became the wealthiest people per capita in the country. One of the people who plotted to separate the Osage from their money was William King Hale. He was eventually linked to twenty-four murders of Osage people with headright claims (which entitled them to shares of the proceeds from the oil produced). Enmeshed in the plot was Hale's nephew, Ernest Burkhart. After he returned from World War I in 1919, Burkhart became part of Hale's plans to gain access to the oil claims by marrying Mollie Kyle. Over the next few years, Mollie's sister Minnie and their mother died from ""wasting disease,"" later proven to be poisoning. Another sister, Anna, was shot to death. Her remaining sister, Reta, was killed when her home was dynamited. Eventually, Mollie went to Washington, DC, and met with President Coolidge to ask for help from the federal government. The federal initiative to track down the killers was the birth of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. This film is based on the non-fiction book by the same name, authored by David Grann.Scorsese relies on familiar and new faces to carry the story along. As ""King"" Hale, Robert De Niro almost makes us forget ""The War with Grandpa,"" ""Dirty Grandpa,"" and ""Meet the Fockers."" Almost. As Ernest Burkhart, Leonardo DiCaprio helps the audience engage with a generally loathsome character. The revelation in this film is Lily Gladstone (TV's ""Billions,"" the films ""First Cow"" and ""Certain Women""). Her Mollie Kyle is wise, funny, strong and altogether appealing.For those familiar with Scorsese's themes, the film's emphasis on corruption, graphic violence and evil will be unsurprising. To demonstrate further how these themes appear repeatedly in American history, he introduces film clips from the Tulsa massacre and has the KKK marching in a local parade without hoods over their faces, demonstrating that the Klan was a fully embedded part of local culture. Scorsese also suggests strongly that the genesis of wealth inequality is the subjugation of the powerless. In his view, for a few to have more, many have to become ""less than.""Despite its many positive attributes, the film is not flawless. The first two acts are slow and uneven, at times feeling bloated and self-indulgent. It's only when the Bureau of Investigation arrives halfway through that the film maintains consistent pacing. Scorsese's focus on Ernest and Mollie also is questionable. Ernest is either corruptly manipulative himself or so unintelligent that he's easily bent to his uncle's machinations. Either way, he's an unappealing character. And while Mollie is feisty, smart, fascinating and well worth our attention, her poor health throughout most of the film (poisoning can do that) makes her character less than it could have been.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a cautionary tale well-told. But one wishes it had shown a little more self-discipline (editing, anyone?) along the way.",positive
128,"No spoilers, this movie is worth to be watch, to stay in the cinema and watch all the details Mr. Scorsese brings on the screen. The details, the story, the ending. No rush, without the felling that you missed something, every detail and every scene woth it! I like so much that in this movie Mr. Scorsese even tho is set up in the past, it brings a bit of details from present, which again adds to Mr. Scorsese brilliance. The actors, are spot on! Never more perfect for the role they play, the colors, the views, the music, the words and the silence is right in the right time. If you have few hours to spend, spend them in a cinema, watching this masterpiece...",positive
129,"Another great expectations of Scorsese filmmaking, great actors, intriguing story were ruined by this unnecessary long timing and unnecessary love for some actors from Scorsese.I don't want to describe yet again all the arguments why this movie is too long. But after watching the movie I was interested in this story and was left with several questions like why Mollie even chose Ernest? Why Ernest did not develop stronger feelings for Mollie? Why uncle William acting like he has whole life ahead? And how he managed to spend rather long time in jail, and then was able to visit Oklahoma?Well, Google had those answers. Photo from 1917 with Mollie and Ernest is explanatory enough, why not very young woman is willing to find her happiness with a man 6 years younger. For those times it meant a lot.But the most choking fact was the age of the King. He was 18 years older than Ernest, and just 12 years older than Mollie. He was 43 when Mollie and Ernest got married! And it terribly changes how do you see him and his relationship with Ernest, Mollie and all Osages. He was not that old and wise friend they knew all life. He was young enough and full of energy.With all respect to DeNiro, but that another Scorseses attempt to have an old friend to play forty years younger person destroys integrity of the story. It looks unnatural and leaving with questions you don't need.",positive
130,"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",positive

I want to immerse myself in this cinematic masterpiece and appreciate every scene for the piece of art that it is.Pre movie

Riveting performances of course - Lily Gladstone is the soul of this movie!I have been watching Leonardo Di Caprio since 'Catch Me If You Can' days and calling him the Best Actor of his generation - Acting masterclasses one after another and this is best performance I have seen of him !At the end of the show, Marty showed up himself at a play and literally asking - Well, I'm 80years old now, please tell me who's been telling better stories and making better films than me uh?!Take a bow, King!

Top notch acting as Lily Gladstone received an Oscar win and I really think DiCaprio should've gotten a nod as well for his performance. De Niro is De Niro. Jesse Plemons is a great young actor and would've loved to see him in the movie a little longer.Great scenery, great acting, great story, great directing...just a little too long and it seemed to really drag on at times during the move. Good movie overall.",positive
134,"The story pace and overall sense of direction felt very similar to Oppenheimer, which is weird because that felt very unique ant these movies came months apart. Great minds seem to be thinking a like. The movie used up its run time of 3 hours and 30 mins very very well. Leo DiCaprio, especially does a tremendous job of leaving the movie in suspense, as we cannot tell if he is the antagonist, or the protagonist movie, and it seems like Ernest Hale (his character) can't seem to decide until the last moment it is a very tragic story of manipulation, murder, betrayal, genocide. The lack of Justice served is in reality, very very unsatisfying ending, but that's what reality is full of At least we got the satisfaction of Ernest, finally being able to stand up to his uncle and make the right decision and get William Hale, convicted of his crimes. Although he had just as much as apart as he did making all of this happen, we do not see any clear motivation from him on why he's doing this other than just pure greed. He seems to love his wife, his family very very much, but yet he still willing to let his wife's sisters and family die this very very tragic and brutal terrorist way. Seems like he feels very indebted to the man, and he realises that there is no way out as he sees that anyone who can be even a potential danger to him, will be killed. Whether he was trying to kill his wife or not, doesn't feel definitive at all. There is also this insane aspect of terror in this movie, Because two sides of the stories mollie and hales family they live in the same house, they visited each other especially William, he spent so much be very very fake and loving to the natives and yet they still realise I mean the number of people is killed. It's very very easy to connect the dots but Molly is sick and she can't do anything and she has children and the money seems to be very very restrictive and she doesn't have full control of it so she can't just escape from the region. It seems. She has to live with Byron someone who is Family is literally trying to kill them and they're living together and her husband Two. It seems that it seems hes poisoning him.",positive
135,"This was a good movie and for being 3 1/2 hrs, plus another 20 of previews, it kept my attention. However, when the movie was done, I regretted the amount of screen time Leo and Bob had. Dicaprio cannot play a convincing idiot pawn and Diniro was not much better in his role, his accent would slip and I would flash back to Goodfellas. This would have been a more compelling film if we had heard from the lesser used characters pov. All the elements were there, but Scorsese is so in love with these two actors that their overabundant presence overshadowed the story. This would have been a more compelling movie without the two unnecessary leads.",positive
136,"Just watched Killers Of The Flower Moon. It was absolutely fantastic from start to finish.It has the usual Scorsese crew behind the scenes, including Thelma Schoonmacher doing the editing role that she has done with every Scorsese film since Woodstock. And features a killer soundtrack of 1920's blues and HIllbilly music, plus the last film score created by Robbie Robertson of The Band.It Stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Deniro and Lilly Poundstone and a massive crowd of others. The film is an American epic Western crime drama film. It is a true story and Its plot centers on a series of Oklahoma murders in the Osage Nation during the 1920s, committed after oil was discovered on tribal land.In the late 1800s, oil was discovered on the Osage Indian Reservation in present-day Osage County, Oklahoma. The members of the Osage Nation earned royalties from oil sales through their federally mandated ""head rights,"" and, as the oil market expanded, they became incredibly wealthy.As word spread, opportunists flocked to Osage lands seeking to separate the Osage from their wealth by any means necessary-even murder.It was May 1921 when the decomposed body of Anna Brown-an Osage Native American-was found in a remote ravine in northern Oklahoma. The undertaker later discovered a bullet hole in the back of her head. Anna had no known enemies, and the case went unsolved.That might have been the end of it, but, just two months later, Anna's mother Lizzie Q suspiciously died. Two years later, her cousin Henry Roan was shot to death. Then, in March 1923, Anna's sister and brother-in-law, Rita and Bill Smith, were killed when their home was bombed.Anna's last living sibling, Mollie Burkhart, was left devastated-and suspiciously afflicted with an ongoing illness.One by one, at least two dozen people-including Osage Native Americans, a well-known oilman, and others-in the area inexplicably turned up dead.And anyone who shared suspicions and accompanying evidence about what may be going on was met with death threats-or killed, like attorney W. W. Vaughn, who was thrown from a train.Newspapers described the murders and fear during this time as the Reign of Terror.Who was behind all the murders?That's what the terrorized community wanted to find out. But a slew of private detectives and other investigators turned up nothing, and some were even trying to sidetrack honest efforts.The Osage Tribal Council asked the federal government to send detectives to investigate. After receiving the petition in April 1923, the newly created Bureau of Investigation (the agency that would become the FBI) assigned agents to the case.Early on, all fingers pointed at William Hale, the so-called King of the Osage Hills. Hale arrived in Oklahoma as a local cattleman, and he bribed, intimidated, lied, and stole his way to wealth and power. He grew even greedier when oil was discovered on the Osage Indian Reservation.Hale's connection to Anna Brown's family was clear: His nephew, Ernest Burkhart, was married to Anna's sister Mollie.And if Anna, her mother, and two sisters died-in that order-all head rights would pass to Ernest, and Hale could take control. The prize? Half-a-million-dollars a year-or more.Solving the case was another matter. The locals weren't talking; Hale had threatened or paid off many of them, and the rest had grown distrustful of outsiders. Hale also planted false leads that sent our agents scurrying across the Southwest.Tom White led a team of four agents who went undercover as an insurance salesman, cattle buyer, oil prospector, and herbal doctor to turn up evidence. Over time, they gained the trust of the Osage as they built the case.Finally, Hale's nephew talked. Then others confessed. Agents proved that Hale ordered the murders of Anna and her family to inherit their oil rights, cousin Henry for the insurance, and others who had threatened to expose him. It's alleged they attempted to kill Mollie by poisoning her, but their attempts were unsuccessful.In January 1929, Hale was convicted and sent to prison. His henchmen-including a hired killer and crooked lawyer-also got time.",positive
137,"While based on a super important and sad historical story, my ratings of the film's beginning, middle, and end go steadily downhill from 10 to 7 to 4. How does that average-out? Lead actors Leonardo DiCaprio (Ernest) and Lily Gladstone (Mollie) are terrific. Robert De Niro is, well, Robert De Niro, which works well if he is a favorite of yours. What starts to fail are the writng, editing, and directing, especially in the final third. Turning exciting facts of the FBI investigation and trial into boring, unbelievable contrivances is a crime in itself. I am amazed at how many well-known film critics have looked the other way and given the film ratings of 9 or 10. My hunch is that they are being politically correct because bringing this historical episode to everyone's attention does merit a 10.",positive
138,"I think this story is so important, and I wish the film had been made long before 2023. I admittedly knew nothing about the Osage Nation prior to watching the film, or most of the events, yet I was crying in anger and disbelief throughout it. So if I feel that way, I cannot imagine how the people directly impacted, and current members of the tribe must feel. Shocking to think that something so unfair and devastating actually happened! The real Molly Kyle was a woman ahead of her times, and Lily Gladstone portrayed her so perfectly. Robert De Niro is also brilliant in his depiction of William King Hale. It made me unexpectedly emotional to see Martin Scorcese in the film at the end. I thought that this was very moving, and demonstrated how important the telling of the story was to him.",positive
139,"The expectations for this movie were awfully high and I feel like it did not deliver. The runtime is insanely too long. If cut an hour short it would have the same effect as it does now. Although you have to appreciate the talent of the Actors and Marty of course, but something just didn't feel right. It didn't have the effect it was supposed to have. I didn't feel touched the way i wanted to. The injustice, the pain these people felt was just not delivered in a way that would really touch the audience. If you are not American and don't know a lot about this part of history it's a great learning piece, but aside from that It just doesn't leave you wanting to learn more or feel for these people the way you should and that's a shame. Still the movie is great in capturing corruption and telling the story of true crime in a respectful way.",positive
140,"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",positive
141,"Maybe because I am not from the TikTok generation (or should I call it Ken generation now), or maybe just because I'm just getting old, I did not find the movie too long at all.With a magnificent reconstitution, beautiful photography, masterful direction and impeccable acting (from all the actors, really), I found it to be a really immersive experience. I felt teleported to Fairfax in the 1920s, like experiencing it first hand. While the story was known (it's in the title!), the plot and the way that characters changed due to events, kept me glued to the screen.Watching ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" was to me like reading a good, long book that takes you in a trip to another era. It's not about constant adrenalin shots; it's about taking the time to get to know the characters, understand their motivations, and feel what it was like to live in that time and place.",positive
142,"After watching for an hour , I expected so much more. Kept thinking that the movie would pick up but it was very slow and boring. With a great cast I expected the movie to be better. My wife and I have been waiting to see the film. I am so thank you that I did not spend movie prices to watch this film. I am a movie buff and a fan of history. Robert De Nero's western Southern accent or whatever it was did not impress me. This movie was way too long and dragged out. We were very disappointed with this version of the story which was supposed to be based on true events. Could have been so much more.",positive
143,"I looked forward to this movie for a long time and I think both my wife and I wanted to Love this movie, but both of us left the theater just going wow, that was really a disappointment. Number one for me is this: the main character, Leo's role, was a giant wreck of a human being, but not in a way that was intriguing or compelling. He just routinely betrays his wife and family, almost completely flat arch. The story itself felt incredibly disjointed and static. Really didn't flow from any point to another, it was more like just this happened and that happened, but it wasn't flowing like a typical well-made movie (especially one by Scorsese) should. And then at the end, having the whole thing wrapped up by a live radio cast was just really kind of incongruous with the rest of the film. I know a lot will disagree with me but in my opinion, this wasn't anywhere near the quality we've come to expect from Scorsese.",positive
144,I read the book and this was very well done in how it was transferred to a story. It has a pretty interesting cast of characters who were all real. It should have been shorter although I was rarely bored. The period detail is perfect - no surprise in a Scorcese film. It also could have benefitted with some title cards showing what year we were now in - Leo and Lilys characters couple had two kids that whose origins were not explained very well. I struggled a bit to keep track of some of the supporting characters and I've read the book. The three leads were exceptional and they really looked like their historical counterparts. This is also a profoundly sad film giving a real insight in how Native American cultures were just obliterated with no thought at all about what was being lost. Also shows why greed is truly one of the deadly sins. Recommended.,positive
145,"After catching the trailers for this film, I was fully expecting it to be the film of the year and a genuine epic. With the cast, the money spent on production and the story Scorsese has to work with, Killers of the Flower Moon really should have delivered. It simply doesn't.The run time would have been fine, had there been any suspense at all. Instead, the first 45 mins spells out exactly what will happen in the film, which then plays out in an extremely repetitive way, for another 2 hours before we reach an ending could have provided some drama, but winds up feeling rushed.The nature of this film is enough to keep you interested throughout, so I can't say that the time dragged too much, but I still left feeling disappointed.Lily Gladstone could well win awards for her performance, and the film could take Cinematography and Costume design too. It is a very well shot film. Unfortunately, it just fails to tell the story that it should.",positive
146,"Killers of the Flower Moon is brutal and powerful story of true life events. Rober DeNiro, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Lily Gladstone give allstar performances that should gain them Oscar nominations. This movie can be very hard to watch as the content shown here is very brutal and honest. The film tells this true crime tale through the lens of a marriage between Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), a World War I veteran who relocates to Oklahoma to work with his rancher uncle, and Mollie Burkhart (Lily Gladstone), a local Osage woman whose family was one of the community's wealthiest. Robert De Niro stars as Ernest's uncle, William Hale. I was unaware of the events that unfold here and had to do my research after watching the film. For anyone who wants to watch a very well made film and get a history lesson I recommend this latest entry from Martin Scorsese. My only minor complaint for this film is that it is overlong and could have been edited together a little better. I feel there could have been some scenes that could have been trimmed down here as the length is over 3 hours and 30 minutes. Killers of the Flower Moon gets a near perfect score from me with 9 stars out of 10.",positive
147,"I find it hard to come to a definite conclusion on this movie. On the one hand, it is definitely not a bad movie, but it leaves me too cold to call it good either. Ultimately I would call it a bit pointless.The story follows Ernest, played by di Caprio who is basically a pathetic 1920s gold digger. Encouraged by his rich uncle (de Niro), he marries sickly Molly (Gladstone), an Osage-Indian. However, Ernest like almost all white men in Osage County is only after the fortune the Osage Indians have created, due to oil drilling licenses.Martin Scorsese directed the movie and he has made some interesting choices, regarding the focus of the movie. Violence is portrayed casually without much emphasis, making it even more barbaric. The unbelievable greed of the men is shown in full detail and made very believable. You can also clearly see how pathetic they actually are, which makes it even harder to understand, how they can be the one in power. Scorsese also follows the real-life events of the story, so there is no happy end and no real justice being served - a great decision from him. The plight of the Osage Indians and their mistreatment is also handled well, though the story is not told through their eyes, so they tend to be a bit sidelined. The acting is quite good, as is the cinematography. There are many long and calm shots with little action. The costumes and set design look quite authentic to really suck you into the 1920s era. The movie apparently cost 200 million $, and I don't know what to do with this information.So with the positives out of the way, let's look at the downside. First, the pacing of the movie is... uhm... interesting. It took me a while to understand which story the movie actually wants to tell. Not much happens, then you think something will happen, tension is built, you are engaged - and then not much happens and the movie slows down again without actually having sped up. It does not help, that the movie constantly jumps in time, without giving you any hint how much time has really passed. Second, people and or events are often introduces or brought up, just to be completely sidelined or forgotten. One example: at one point in the movie the Klu-Klux-Clan is constantly mentioned and brought up and you think ""Oh, they got something to do with this???"". Then the clan marches in a parade in the city (a scene that has nothing to do with anything) and then it is never seen or mentioned again. So...why?! And finally the movie struggles to engage fully over its enormous runtime of 200 minutes. The story centers around the killings of the Osage Indians. Yet, there is no mystery or suspense. The viewer basically knows who did it and the why is made clear as well: greed. However, the movie keeps on circling around the murders without telling anything new. You just wait for the resolution of the movie - which feels weirdly rushed and not thought through. Again, this movie is 200 minutes long and ends with you being read the obituaries of the protagonists.Ultimately nothing is really bad about this movie, but nothing is too engaging or great about it either. I am happy though that this movie is allowed to exist!",positive
148,"Martin Scorsese means farewell. A masterpiece in its own right - 200 minutes of interweaving scenes about the job, betrayal, love and kills which probably won't find an equal in #MovieSeason2023 - the picture is so well thought out that you never knew what struck you. Walk in, walk out, return; the audience finds masterful filmmaking with immersive engaging cast lead by Leonard DiCaprio who gives a torturing performance of a lifetime supported by L. Gladstone as the Native American wife who is closest to the Oscar, I haven't seen in years.Sadly enough, the audience prefers Oppenheimer for its allegory about the bomb which probably both will end up for the Best Picture race on March 10th 2024.",positive
149,"Killers of the Flower Moon is directed and produced by Martin Scorsese, who co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Roth, which is based on the 2017 book of the same name by David Grann. The direction is truly top notch, Martin Scorsese directed a cinematic masterpiece with just the right length. Scorsese was extremely passionate regarding the source material, the true events, and of course the Osage Nation. Even spending several hours together with Chief Standing Bear to convince the Osage Nation to help with the filming. You see the attention to detail and passion in the screenplay, also in the direction and visual storytelling. The first drafts of Killers of the Flower Moon had it following the book, then the focus shifted on the Osage Nation and the native americans. You could say the first hour of the film feel like a different movie than the rest, because of how they're building the plot and characters, and giving the Osage people more screen time made this a much deeper story as we feel what they're going through and Scorsese interrupts the script perfectly and tells this story in a magnificent way. The film looks absolutely stunning and the camera angles which Scorsese used are so important for its dialogue scenes and others. The mise-en-scene is absolutely perfect, Martin Scorsese sets up a scene brilliantly, each scene and frame ends up looking beautiful and spectacular. Rodrigo Prieto served as the cinematographer for the film (whom worked on Wolf of Wall Street, Silence and The Irishman prior to this), and the cinematography is just stunning, what a beautiful looking film and s great cooperation between these two filmmakers. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing was truly perfect, along with Martin Scorsese, these two made a 3.5 hour film feel like a 2.5 hour film. The pacing was great, not too slow and not too fast, a nice pacing for an epic drama western.When oil is discovered in 1920s Oklahoma under Osage Nation land, the Osage people are murdered one by one - until the FBI steps in to unravel the mystery.Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone lead an ensemble cast that includes Jesse Plemons, Tantoo Cardinal, John Lithgow, Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers and JaNae Collins. About the acting, Leonardo DiCaprio is absolutely perfect in the role and so is Lily Gladstone. DiCaprio transforms himself into Ernest Burkhart, a different accent to different mannerisms, that might be one of his best performances yet. Getting multiple scenes throughout the 3.5 hour runtime to show off his acting, from monologues to other scenes. He also got to share a lot of scenes with Lily Gladstone who portrays Mollie Burkhart, Ernest's Native American wife. Her performance has so much emotion and is the character who gets the trademark voiceover lines, which are a small part of the film yet important. Like DiCaprio, it's an award-worthy performance. Robert De Niro is great but not as great as he used to or could be, the accent is far from perfect but worked for me yet my friend criticized that. Maybe it's him growing older or all the incoming projects, who knows, it could have been greater but I'm happy with what we got. Robert De Niro does a fantastic job with bringing the real life figure William King Hale to the screen, it's a three dimensional character and De Niro is a huge part of making this evil man three dimensional when it could have been easy to show one of his layers, the pure evil side.Killers of the Flower Moon captures the time period, the Osage Nation, and every other detail perfectly. The locations used and sets that were built, makes for such a great experience for us viewers as it feels real. The production design and value of overall production were truly superb, so was the art direction. It was the final collaboration between Scorsese and his musical partner, Robbie Robertson who died back in August. His musical score fits the film perfectly, just wish there was more of it. It's bluesy and percussive, also quite old timey.David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter commented on the length, ""The three-and-a-half-hour running time is fully justified in an escalating tragedy that never loosens its grip"" and praised the screenplay, direction, cinematography, score, and cast performances (particularly that of Lily Gladstone). That summarizes it perfectly. This was my first experience with a Martin Scorsese film at the cinema and it was an unforgettable experience, a film without flaws (possibly too long for some but you can easily watch it in two parts at home if you wish so). It's nice to see Martin Scorsese so passionate about a project, which he was for Silence and The Irishman. What a beautiful looking movie, but what a depressing story told brilliantly by Martin Scorsese.",positive
150,"I didn't think Scorsese was capable of making a movie that could lose me. When I watch ""Casino"", ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", ""The Irishman"", it's like I'm in a trance. I pay no heed to the time and I enjoy the length. I wish these epic-length movies were longer.With ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", though, I didn't feel that way. It's three-and-a-half hours, but it doesn't feel like it needs to be.Its length taxed me because the story the movie tells is so distressing. I had never heard of it before. I wonder if it is well known in America? Americans don't seem to know much about their Indigenous population.Such a horrible story demands attention. It happened, so the least we can do is bear witness and know about it. Dragging the story out, this long, though, I often looked away.I also thought the Native American characters kind of got short shrift here. There are hardly any Native Americans on screen anyway. This is their story. But it didn't feel like it.I will probably re-watch ""Killers of the Flower Moon"". Scorsese may be the best living director, so I feel like I owe it to him to give it another go. If I do, hopefully I'll change my mind and be able to give it a better review.",positive
151,"Very very very long!Too boring. No catch to hold the attention.Obvious plot. Good actors but even the acting is quite common.Bad movie...too much hype.De Niro looks the same ""mafia"" type.Di Caprio trying to replicate Marlon Brando from Godfather does not succeedThe Indians talking not in English all the time without any translation is complete unnecessary.Even the murders are simple and obvious. There is no mistery, no suspense.Brendan Fraser and John Litgow with small participations that don't cause any impact.The actress that plays Mollie is the only good thing about this terrible movie.",positive
152,"Killers of the Flower Moon is one of the bleakest films from Martin Scorsese. Marty is no stranger to making movies with challenging topics, but here, the film focuses on a dark but forgotten time in history. While watching the film, you can tell and feel that a master film marker like Martin Scorsese made it.The performance from everyone was fantastic. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as the simple-minded but devilishly charming Ernest Burkhart. DiCaprio looks dirty and unwashed in this movie, and I can only describe him as a pile of dirty clothes.Robert De Niro delivers one of his best performances in what feels like ages, as when he puts in the work, he is one of the best actors ever. He plays William Hale, a vile but cunning man who hoodwinked the Osage Nation through his trustworthy and helpful persona. All promises to keep the Osage people safe and bring them justice after the mysterious killings of their people were nothing more than monstrous lies. He hated them all. It is still scary and relevant that high-powered people in leadership preach promises for a better way of life for the people, but they lie and secretly could not care less. Sadly, this is nothing new and will forever be relevant for future generations.But it is Lily Gladstone who is the heart and soul of the film as Mollie Burkhart. Even when she speaks no words, her expressive eyes convey so much. This is the first movie I have seen Gladstone in (I have not seen Certain Women yet), and she is a stand-out and stayed with me long after the movie ended.The cinematographer, production work, and the score from the late Robbie Robertson were all superb, especially the score. In the opening scene, where Osage men dance around the column of erupting oil in slow motion, and Robertson's score kicks in, I knew I was in for a great movie.My only issue with the movie is some of the pacing can be sluggish at parts. The more I think about it, this should have been a TV mini-series because you can only do as much as it can with a theatrical runtime in a film.Putting aside that, what I got the most out of the movie is the focus on evil and greed in people. And the twisted love story between Ernest and Mollie Burkhart. Ernest, behind her back, is slowly killing her family members one by one, including Mollie, but while doing this, he still loves her.The horrifying realisation is that the people who caused the worst and most inhuman atrocities can also greet you with a smile and hug, treat you like a friend, and make you feel safe and at home, all without knowing their sinister intentions.",positive
153,"Excellent, among the best of the year, one of those that make you even more interested in the story, outside of the film. I don't know what problem people have with the duration, they should be more willing to watch a three and a half hour movie, you know in advance that it is a long movie. The rhythm is perfect and there are no scenes left over. What's more, they could have extended it more if they decided to develop the FBI plot more.Excellent performances, especially by De Niro who becomes indecipherable at times.Technically it is an improvement over The Irishman, Scorsese's previous film, where although it was a good film, on a technical level certain problems drew too much attention.",positive
154,"Much like the book this film has dozens of characters to keep straight which is hard. You really have to pay attention. But the book was about the very early days of the FBI and the heroic squeaky clean Agent White who unraveled this tragic disturbing true story. I was looking forward to this story but was given another angle on the tale.Maybe because of Leonardo's $30 Million dollar payday the movie is about him and his uncle King Hale. Oh, and a few dozen Indian victims. Also added the Tulsa racial murders in case we had forgotten that white people are bad.Great performances of course but what is wrong with this picture is it's extreme length of 3 1/2 hours. With coming attractions and commercials this was a 4 hour sitting without an intermission? Before the film officially ended without watching the credits seemingly the entire audience rushed to the rest room. The talk in the rest rooms and lobby was about the lack of an intermission and stressed bladders. No one was talking about the movie?Sorry Marty. I think you missed an opportunity here at a great film about the FBI.",positive
155,"Killers of the Flower Moon is another masterpiece from Scorsese as he goes all out on the runtime and brings out the best in DiCaprio and De Niro as usual. But Lily Gladstone's performance as a troubled Osage woman with deteriorating health, surrounded by death and betrayal, is what carries the movie.The movie feels long but not slow by any means. The courtroom scenes could have definitely been cut way shorter. Also, there was a lack of mystery, as every character's intentions had been clear since the start.However, it is a safe movie that touches on a social issue that hasn't been talked about much and doesn't fail to keep the audience entertained.",positive
156,"The most awaited film of the year has finally arrived at the cinema, except that this great expectation has caused me even more pain... three hours and twenty minutes is really too much for a film that is based almost exclusively on dialogue, has a soundtrack almost non-existent sound, long frames of non-sensical images, what can I say? Terribly verbose, pedantic, exhausting. Well the positive sides if not the impeccable performance of DiCaprio and De Niro, as well as the antagonistic part they play embarrasses me somewhat, I believe that what most balances the vote unfortunately is the denunciation of the wrongdoings against the Indian minorities of the time. Having said that this film is not Titanic nor even Gone with the Wind, it does not justify the 3.20 film length... it's a shame that someone like Scorsese doesn't have in mind the excellent rules of the old classic Hollywood films which sometimes lasted just 1 hour and 15 minutes but they left you with so much more. Lengthy.",positive
157,"This is an incredibly moving, tragic, grim, dark story about an attempted genocide committed against the Osage people at the turn of the century. One that everyone should have known about for years, but sadly had been swept under the rug. Because Native people were not deemed as important as white people when they were killed in masses. As one character puts it: a man had more chances of being convicted of killing a dog than an Indian.In regards to its excessive runtime, if anyone can make a very long movie feel much shorter, it's Martin Scorsese.His films are always so well paced and written that, that , unlike many other films of today, it makes the time pass quickly because it's so immersive, captivating and fascinating.This film brings home all of his common traits: greed, corruption, incompetent criminals, narration, and murder. This is the first time in a long time, however, that a female character gets Scorsese's narrative treatment. Mollie Burkhart (played brilliantly by Lily Gladstone) is the movie's beating heart in a sea of horrific sabotage and slayings. In many of the director's other movies, there is a problematic trope of women being portrayed as nothing more than gold-diggers with pretty faces. In this film however, it's reversed. Leo DiCaprio wants to marry Gladstone's character for her money. It was another nice little change that I appreciated.This film could, potentially, have also done well as a miniseries (expanding on the story and the background of its setting and characters) but I'm still really glad we still get to witness the mastery of Scorsese's genius directing and storytelling.",positive
158,"I was disappointed in the movie, in a different yet similar way as The Irishman. I think Scorsese has gotten too expositional and unable to self-edit enough. Too many long, drawn out scenes, including many with tons of intense dialogue. It's well acted, but I don't love any one performance in the film.And there just aren't enough great movie scenes. I wasn't moved. I wasn't thrilled. It WAS engrossing. Not particularly too long, because you are interested in the story. They just take too long to tell it, and, frankly, it's such an ugly, unpleasant story, that it's nearly impossible to be a fan.I also feel like people will be afraid to insult the movie for fear of looking like they don't like American Indians. A look into their culture wasn't as compelling as it should have been. The movie has its moments, but it was a letdown, overall, for me.",positive
159,"Scorsese at his best. DeCaprio at his best. DeNiro is being DeNiro. Three and a half hour epic story of murder, cheating, and high crimes with no misdemeanors. Not a slow pace film but the three and half run time might have been trimmed a bit. Great performances and the cinematography is top notch. Feels like a mob movie but set in 1920s Oklahoma, where sickness and poverty rule the day. The ending is reminiscent in some ways to Goodfellas. Pathetic characters who committed crimes to Osage tribe all for oil. DeNiro breaks out his Max Cady vocal tone toward the end of the film when he turns himself in. I watched this one at home on Apple Plus. I loved this film.",positive
160,"Flat is the word I would use to describe this film. Upon reading up on the true events that 'Killers of the Flower Moon"" is based upon, I felt both outraged and deeply saddened. When watching this film, I really felt neither. The film doesn't have enough tension, there are no great characters, no particularly memorable scenes and with an audacious run time of three and a half hours - an out of place ending that implies Scorsese still did not have enough time to tell this story properly. Far from creative and just all together bizarre, the ending is actually distracting and seems an oddly goofy way of concluding a tale of mass murder.",positive
161,"Its painfully long. Its like Mississippi Burning on major tranquillisers. Without the soundtrack, character development ,dialogue ,or acting. DiCaprio just thinks acting is frowning permanently and Di Niro added nothing.Not a hugely interesting story. Stretched for hours with no point. Every seen was three times the lenght it needed to be.DiCaprio is just back from WW1 aged 49 which at the turn of last century was approaching geriatric. His uncle in his fifties was played by an 80 year old. There was just no point to any of it. Even the cinematography was drab.One of the longest most pointless boring badly acted films I have ever endured.",positive
162,A captivating 3.5 hours long epic that rarely felt stretched or monotonous.The iconic duo of Marty and De Niro still packs the same punch in their 80's as they did back in 1976. One of the best performances of Leo and De Niro (in recent times). But the surprising show stopper was undeniably Lily Gladstone. Her performance had the almost perfect blend of subtlety and expressive acting. She deserves to be nominated and maybe even win the best actress category this year.Cinematography and background score are the unsung heroes and keeps even seemingly long takes interesting and captivating.Thankful for a time where thoughtful impactful cinema having long run times like this excelling over the multiverse/ action packed/ CGI studded pop-culture flicks.,positive
163,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a 2023 American epic western crime drama film, is based on David Grann's 2017 non-fiction book of the same name. Directed and co-produced by Martin Scorsese, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Roth, the film showcases Scorsese's signature style, albeit in a more balanced manner.The cinematography is particularly noteworthy. The movie employs varying camera shots (overhear, medium closeup, full level shots) frame ratios, seamlessly transitioning between black and white and colorful scenes. The color palette reminds me of Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) striking a perfect balance between historical authenticity and visual appeal. However, the film's length feels excessive for its content. While I personally find the narrative structure of Christopher Nolan's films quite intriguing and could envision some scenes in 'Killers of the Flower Moon' being similarly rearranged, I fully respect and appreciate Martin Scorsese's unique artistic vision. His choices greatly impact the film's unique character and storytelling style.The performances by Lily Gladstone, Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio really stands out. Their ability to express deep emotions adds a layer of depth to the movie, enhancing its overall impact. The costumes and cars add remarkable detail and accurately represent the time of the Osage people. The movie's filming locations were chosen for their cultural and historical importance, which makes the movie more authentic.The soundtrack fits the film's vibe, complementing the visuals and the narrative effectively. What is particularly astonishing is Martin Scorsese's ability to create such a film at the age of 81. His willingness to take creative risks at this stage of his career is both surprising and inspiring.In conclusion, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" shows Scorsese's talent with his remarkable cinematographic style, his motivation to shoot a film by combining historical accuracy, engaging storytelling, and great filmmaking.",positive
164,"All of us agree it was too long and too slow. The story was and remains worth hearing, but this was the wrong vessel in which to do it. A 3.5 hour epic told this story far too slowly, and didn't explore what we would have really enjoyed seeing, eg Leo and Mollie's romance, and the corruption of the other relationships. Money changes everything.This was an excellent movie in a mediocre movie's clothing. I applaud Scorsese for his desire to tell this story, but this was done incorrectly. Call it Goodfellas meets Dances With Wolves and Once Upon A Time in America. And call it too long.I'm guessing that the trailers were almost more valuable than the film itself in telling the story, and that should never happen when we're taking about a Scorsese film.",positive
165,"Very unique story about a topic not often talked about. After the movie I felt obligated to learn more about the history that was told here. The scenes and dialogue are beautifully done. The story builds up in a very organic way towards the end. The cast of this movie is also part of what makes this a succes, together with the amazing shots. Only negative in my opinion is the length of the movie. I understand that there needs to be space for long organic conversation, however it is too much. Cutting out some of the not so relevant scenes would benefit this movie. The same story could be told in a 3hour movie.",positive
166,"I recently had the opportunity to watch ""Killing of the Flower Moon"" in the cinema. The story unfolds in an intriguing manner, and it features some exceptionally well-crafted scenes that captivate the audience. However, the film's runtime of over three hours felt somewhat excessive, leaving me with a sense of it being unnecessarily protracted. This extended length, unfortunately, takes away from the overall experience, making it somewhat tedious. Despite the extra time, the characters are not given the depth and development they deserve. It's a bit of a letdown that, despite the extended duration, we don't get to connect with the cast as deeply as one might hope for.",positive
167,"This movie was long but the performance of the cast was captivating which made this movie a worthwhile experience to have. The Story was interesting and unique, The pacing was slow but the story made up for it. The Cinematography was Brilliant, Every scene was shot with a good understanding of the story, and the background music was perfect with the cinematography which was entertaining. The cast was Brilliant in their roles and gave an excellent performance, Especially Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, All of them portrayed their characters very uniquely which made this movie a memorable experience to have. I liked the suspense in the story it made me focus on the details in this movie, The overall story was good and the way they ended the story was satisfying as well. This Movie has Crime, Drama, History, Mystery, Romance, and Western. The reason why I gave this movie an 9 is the Story, Cinematography, and Cast, All were brilliant in making this movie worth watching, and for that, I gave them an 9, Other than that the duration of this movie was very long which was a little frustrating but still the story was interesting which made up for it...",positive
168,"This was such a beautiful movie, clearly made by someone who loves his craft. This movie brings all of Hollywood's heavy hitters - De Nino, Scorsese, DiCaprio - together to tell a haunting story that will linger with you long after the credits roll. Yet, one cannot feel that this is not quite the magnum opus for the trio that it might have been.The movie's most glaring weekness is that the twist, or hook, is no great mystery. Anyone familiar with the genre or American history could have devised the treachery afoot from the first or second scene between misters DiCaprio and De Niro. After that the first act drrrraaaaaggggsss along until you've lost interest in the story by the time the FBI shows up.All in all I did love this film because it is the type of big budget movie you so rarely see from Hollywood anymore and because the cast and direction is incredible. However, it's too long, and I don't know that I would ever watch it again. It doesn't reach the entertainment brilliance of Goodfellas or Casino or The Departed. But it is worth the one watch for its truly haunting story and its sheer uniqueness amidst a sea of soulless popcorn flicks.",positive
169,"Let's get to the point; yes, this movie is long, even for Star Wars enthusiasts and lovers of description overload, but it is an absolutely stunning piece of cinematography, with fantastic acting, about a part of American history, involving Native American oppression and racism that must be told!Often in America, when we think of systemic racism, African Americans come to mind, and in fact the plight and struggles of black people, dealing with generational poverty and lack of opportunities, has rightly dominated Hollywood's narrative for the last 40 years or so. Now, I think the time has finally come to shine a light on other groups of Americans, who have also seen their lands stolen, who have been pushed to live in the fringe of society (reservoirs), who have been culled and had their lifespans dramatically reduced (Native American women have the youngest mortality rates), and who's stories have been ignored for way too long. THIS is a story about love (of family, of land, and of heritage), survival/resilience, and about a country ultimately learning from their mistakes and wanting to do better!Bravo, Mr Scorsese, for taking such time and care to get this story right, and in doing so, creating a work of art that pays tribute to the Osage Nation and to Mollie Kyle and her family.",positive
170,"This was an incredibly well made movie: the acting (especially Lily Gladstone), the stunning cinematography, the set design... all top-notch. But for some reason I had the same feeling when the credits rolled on Scorsese's last 3.5 hours epic, The Irishman, as I did here. Which is to say, I was hoping for more. And I was also hoping for less.To be clear, this was a vital story to share, and I also think it should've been told by an Indigenous filmmaker. At 210 minutes, this film was massive in runtime, but somehow still felt emotionally stunted, and I believe the fault of that lies squarely on the length, the screenplay, and the direction. It's impossible to fault the acting - absolutely everyone was tremendous. The full development of the characters just wasn't there.",positive
171,"Having read the spectacular book several times, I was excited to see this film. They wasted 3 hours showcasing DeNiro who plays himself as a boring soulless nasty old man. If only they'd limited his time on screen to 30 minutes the story might have been told with dignity. DeCaprio grunted through 3 hours, but Plemons should have filled at least an hour as the FBI man honoring that agencies' first case. He was terrific in the part! Molly was the shining star. As could have been the other indigenous actors. I love Scorcese, but his version of a finale had me shouting ""No!"" In the theatre. Just ""NO!""",positive
172,"Oil! That word has been making environmental activists angry and greedy capitalists happy for a long time now. This story, set in the 1920s, showcased plenty of dramatized sequences and real-life archival footage to expose just how deeply entrenched oil has always been in the global consciousness, including North America.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" soon proved to be an apt title for the lengths money-hungry land grabbers would go just to control oil. In this seedy endeavour, humanity was flung out the window, particularly where Native-American lives were concerned.More than any 'feel good' sentiments, this tale was a study in fairness, deception, thievery, racism, and m√©salliance.The movie also didn't shy from showing how some Native-American tribes were commercially thriving off the oil found on their land. The plot centred around the Osage tribe who, in the 20s, called Oklahoma their home. They grew rich off the oil found in their territory, but that only drew the eye of certain white people, especially the Hales, who wanted what they had.Murders and massacres followed, which eventually dragged the FBI into the thick of things. Their investigation, however thorough, seemed like it would meet a dead-end in the halls of white politics.Giving memorable performances were Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart and Leonardo DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart. Their so-called marriage hit a special kind of rock-bottom when truths, as they are prone to do, revealed themselves.Gladstone especially gave a heart-wrenching performance that deserves all the appreciation it can get. She is a legitimate member of the Blackfeet Indian tribe. Lily Gladstone did her race proud by showcasing one version of their rage and pain, as experienced through the eyes of a wife who was deceived and dejected by her own husband, whom she trusted.Robert De Niro as local patriarch William Hale and Jesse Plemons as FBI Detective Tom White were outstanding in their respective roles. Their characters were as calculating as they were compelling, and doubly relevant within the confines of this story.All the other artists, especially Native-American ones, did exceptional work telling this story. Despite it being three and a half hours long (give or take), the movie was worth its runtime. I especially liked how generous they were with using Native-American language for entire dialogue sequences.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" was based on the non-fiction biography titled ""Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI"" by David Grann. I have not read the book, but I'm sure it held some deeply uncomfortable truths; if this movie was anything to go by.I've long been a fan of Martin Scorsese's work. What he accomplished in ""Flower Moon"" along with screenplay writer Eric Roth is nothing less than a testament to intricate filmmaking.Scorsese successfully highlighted a criminally overlooked part of American history, and gave the original Native-Americans sisters who featured in this dark chapter of the past some measure of dignity.Considering how a few contemporary U. S. politicians are seemingly hard at work trying to cover up past injustices against African-American people, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" proved that much has not changed in the past several decades since the 'roaring 20s'.Ironically, the 20s were a time of social revolution, but apparently one that was devoid of social justice where the Osage murders were concerned.",positive
173,"I just had the pleasure of watching ""Killers of the Flower Moon. I found this film to be very engaging, and I am glad to see the truth coming out in more recent years. In California we have some literature about the genocide of the indigenous people here, but very little was written down. I have heard old stories and make up thoughts to flesh out those stories. I appreciate that this story was both written down, and also interpreted with the Osage Nation Members. The costume was just beautiful, as were the indigenous actors. I always delight in their way. I was very glad that I rented this movie in support of this type of media. What strikes me the most is that everyone was intertwined, almost as if they seemed to have no way to stop the madness while living out a grotesque version of life. I guess that this rings true, even today, as we all know where the tax dollars go, and for what purpose, yet we live on in the inevitable denial of natural law. Hopefully, we can get to a point where we actually account for all lives. All of them. Films like this are a good first step to that point in the future.",positive
174,"This is good bad story.This is model of U. S. policy around the world.People who already live in prosperity, have power, do terrible things and only think about how to get even richer. Moreover, the organizer is an old man who has almost lived his life.It's also a pity to see my favorite aging actors, especially De Niro.I love DiCaprio, but judging by the plot, his role should have been played by a young man, at least he should have been young at the beginning of the film. It was worth working on his image. His character is tired and motionless throughout the film.De Niro played a nasty old man well.",positive
175,"Is it true what people say? That Killers of the Flower Moon is Martin Scorsese contemplating his own career? That he is telling us something here, not just about the evils of American history, but about the way the filmgoing public has responded to movies (including but not limited to ones directed by him) about said evils? Several 2023 pictures (from Fincher's The Killer to Anderson's Asteroid City) have been read as the director ""contemplating his own career"", but Killers of the Flower Moon, for reasons I will not spoil here, is one of the more convincing examples.In any event, Killers of the Flower Moon is masterful like only Scorsese knows how -- from the lifelike performances (Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro are as great as ever, but the standout here is undoubtedly Lily Gladstone) to the intricately coordinated tracking shots. It bored me ever so slightly a few times, yet I couldn't in good conscience ask that it be cut down, partly because I do believe the story requires all of these scenes and because one does not simply say that to Thelma Schoomaker.In my original review, in response to the idea that Scorsese's filmography -- or a good chunk of it -- functions as a timeline of American ""toxic masculinity"", I wrote that ""more broadly than that, his films are about sin; it is fitting that his (maybe) final film would go back to the founding sins, complete with a confession scene where Gladstone gets her finest moment"".Of course, in reality, I hope Scorsese has more pictures in him and that he sticks around -- preferably forever -- to stick up for real cinema, but if this is where it ends, it could scarcely have been on a more meaningful note.",positive
176,"The pacing was so bad for such a long movie l have seen long movies where the time flies by because the audience was riveted. I was bored and ready for it to be over by the 2 hour mark. I'd give it a 7 (story worth telling, good acting, well made) but wait to stream it so you can take an intermission at home. Oppenheimer is a movie that needed to be seen on a big screen for the theatrical benefits and worth the run time. Scorsese needs to set his ego aside and edit his movies better. It's a shame because this story of the Osage murders and the audience deserved better than a slow paced movie with minimal tension.",positive
177,"We really liked this movie! Would we recommend it to everyone? No. Will the 3.5 hour run time deter some people from watching it? Absolutely.With that being said, we do expect multiple Oscar nominations for this film, so if you care about that you will want to see it.This movie takes you through the story of the Osage Indian tribe in the 1920s. This tribal land sits on very productive oil fields, which caused the tribe to become very wealthy. Where money goes, greed soon follows, and this lead to the murders of multiple tribe members in an effort to funnel money into the pockets of the greedy. The murders were not investigated until a tribe member begged the president of the United States to do something. As the investigation unfolds, the insane and heartbreaking truth comes out.Scorsese worked closely with the Osage tribe to make sure this story was told accurately and respectfully, which we think he successfully did. It's a slow and methodical story that lets the viewers immerse in the emotion and lives of the characters on screen. The acting by the whole cast (specifically Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone) was top notch. And the cinematography was beautifully executed.We would say this one is worth the watch - especially for movie lovers. If you don't want to sit in a theater for that long, wait a few weeks and catch it on Apple TV+ from the comfort of your own home.",positive
178,"Reviewed by Filmmining101:""Killers of the Flower Moon"" marks Martin Scorsese's first film since his larger than life greatest hits compilation of the gangster genre in ""The Irishman"" (2019). Adapting the book of the same name, this time there is no distracting de-ageing CGI or a profound sense of deja-vu. Instead this epic western sheds light into an American era that has remained forgotten in history books, rarely featured in modern conversations regarding ethnic cleansing.This could be easily be ""Gangs of Oklahoma"" with the systematic killing of rich Native Americans after World War I fitting nicely into the thematically diverse filmography of the American-Italian director. The Osage were considered second rate citizens until of course, they stabled black gold across their land attracting riches and a life of luxury much to the displeasure of the average (and in a nice hint white-supremacist) American. Enter white vultures who devised a plan to inherent this type of money by marrying their women and killing their relatives one by one in a slasher like fashion.In this admirable and passionate labor of love, Scorsese tackles the movie's delicate subject through a respectful lens using valuable input from the Indigenous community on a scale that has not seen before since Michael Mann's ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1992). A master of tension, he slowly raises the dramatic stakes asphyxiating the audience when shocking violence erupts making this a hard to watch film. As this subject has not been explored before, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" presents a unique opportunity to present these events from a fresh perspective: the Native American one showcasing the harsh reality that many members of the Osage tribe faced back then.However, the primary emphasis on DiCaprio's (despicable) character really grinds the proceedings to a halt. Easily in need of a 45 minute trim, how many times do you have to see him and De Niro scheming? The script makes it clear from the opening that they are out for blood so any meaningful moments between DiCaprio and his prey (Lily Gladstone) lack the necessary tension. We never get to know (or even understand) her point of view, a fatal flaw considering the amount of tragedy she experiences in a sea of endless betrayals and emotional manipulation.In the inevitable final act, Scorsese performs a swan dive bringing together all the failed and successful schemes but in this effort he highlights the Natives as complete lighthearted and almost naive individuals in their own movie. ""Killers"" becomes more an expensive Hollywood vehicle for DiCaprio's A-list status something that is echoed in the prolonged finale where the script offers an unremarkable pseudo-redemption arc for a thinly sketched protagonist. This marks ""Killers"" a wasted opportunity to detail in depth the murderous circumstances that plunged the Osage tribe almost into oblivion. The variety of names, locations and acts might even further alienate those who can't keep track of who is who and who killed whom as events and people are referenced and are rarely seen.In their 6th collaboration (""Gangs of New York"" (2002), ""The Aviator"" (2004), ""The Departed"" (2006), ""Shutter Island"" (2010), ""The Wolf of Street Street"" (2013)) together, ""Killers"" is perhaps the least noteworthy acting wise for DiCaprio. Easily overshadowed by De Niro (who can play this type of role in his sleep), his one note parasite with a permanently distracting facial expression is utterly unmemorable. Yet, the film belongs to Lily Gladstone who invokes quite moments of strength and dignity further echoing sentiments of making her the main heroine while a few selected cast members do standout in their limited screentime including a fresh from his Oscar Brendan Fraser and John Lithgow.Opposing vehemently the state of modern cinema, the greatest living director today however is at his worst still the best amidst a sea of mediocre and idiotic puppets who kiss the a** of large corporations (e.g., Disney) for shallow entertainment and a quick buck. You would think this engaging story could not be visually represented through a Scorses-ian eye, yet here we are, the beloved New Yorker employing all his signature tricks: one (and complex) track shots, slow mo, authentic soundtrack, atmospheric and spotless cinematography and of course a technically superb production and costume design that does shine on the big screen.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a splashy auteuristic output with a $200 million dollar price tag that does not involve a flying cape, a blue beam and copious amounts of unrendered CGI but features a story in need to be told, heard and seen even if this hugely ambitious artistic gamble loses its compelling focus during the last act.",positive
179,"From the beginning it was clear that the style of the movie would be slow and deliberate. The Robbie Robertson score was the heartbeat of the story and early dialogue reiterated the Osage Indian way of communicating with the White Man.While the book takes the point of view of the investigation and the FBI, the movie follows Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) and is a study on the situation he found himself if between his uncle, who befriended the community in order to get as close as possible for evil purpose, and his Osage wife, who's family and community were under attack.To see Ernests' struggle was like watching an analogy for how a general population can be led into temptation without remorse. To see the plight of the Osage community switches the focus back onto true American History, not a black eye, but straight out thievery.The details in the book could not be expressed in the cinema due to the need to focus on the story, so it's far from a documentary recreation, but it is a careful, poignant and meaningful recreation of a story inside American History that some may not want to see for admission that our country's heart may be in the right place (eventually when they benefit from it) but their hand is always in your pocket.Headrights, inheritance, not being allowed to handle one's own money and indifference to life. It's all here as well as the personal story of Molly Butkhart (Lily Gkadstone). She's as stoic as one can be amidst such evil. It's her who the movie focuses at the end as it's really her story and who you're thinking about leaving the theater.Robert DiNero is fine as Willian Hale, if not simply obvious. But since he understands his prey better than anyone, he is able to manipulate the events the way the director, Martin Scorsese manipulates the audience. The appearance of other famous actors towards the end of the long movie experience was charming but distracting.This will play out on Apple TV but I'm glad to have seen it in the auditory confines among respectful theater goers. This was a worth Cinefile Event.",positive
180,"I had high hopes for this movie, which featured the powerhouse trio of Scorsese behind and DiCaprio and De Niro in front of the camera, yet the end result is a boring, overlong and very disappointing mess.The trailer showed some real promise, but the movie was nothing like it. A relatively interesting premise was stretched too thin and with little to no surprises along the way, I was waiting for it to end.I was baffled to find out that the movie bombed at the box office, but now I can get why.Scorsese is still searching for his mojo after his last dull movie epic experiment (The Irishman), but this is far from his best. DiCaprio looks washed up and rather disinterested, while other high profile cameos from big names like Branden Fraser and John Lithgow are wasted.Killers of the Flower Moon is my pick for the year's most boring movie. You can find something more meaningful to do for 3.5 hours.",positive
181,"This is a fantastic opportunity to work with one of the leading studios and one of the most renown Directors. You will be responsible for editing future and current films to sensible cuts so stories don't drag and create a positive and enjoyable experience for the audience. You must be able to influence the Director!!After watching Killers of the Flower Moon, this was my only thought as I walked out of the cinema! Its obviously a very important story to the American Native people and rightly so this will focus and educated globally (I am from the UK and was not aware of this part of US History).However this overblown, almost unedited version could have easily run at 2 hours and delivered a more impactful message. I appreciate that Scorcese has directed some modern classics, but he needs a new editor that has the ability to stand up to him!Im also not convinced by DiCaprio, there is a line in the film where he says ""he just loves the money"" there was no acting invloved there! He was wooden and at no time did I ever get a sense of the true feelings of his character. Dont get me started on DeNiro, he has the same style in every film nowadays.Yes its shot well and I presume the period look is right (you'd expect it to be for 200mil) but its too long, lacks any likeable characters other than Molly (just about!). The best part by far is the radio show end, which is exactly how this film could have been delivered!!",positive
182,"This movie was incredibly well written and directed on a level I couldn't see many directors handle it to keep the pace and balance over a length of 3 1/2 hours. This movie needed that time to tell its story. I always admired native Americans for their tradition, craftsmanship,water economy, agriculture & leechcraft. Osage story wasn't popular in the part of the world where I live. I was shocked that this story felt untold even though it was written and published in a book. It seemed like United States of America rather ignored the past. There are so many unsolved and untold horrible events about indigenous people. I'm happy from the bottom of my heart that one of the best directors of all time made this movie with a top notch roster of actors.Killers of the Flower Moon is a movie that focuses with deep betrayal, greed, grieve and psychotic trust issues. These crimes to the Osage tribe is unforgivable. The way how they expose the sinister side of the white people towards the Osage tribe was vicious & shocking for me as a viewer. The way these people only show fake love and trust to get to their goal= money from the crude oil makes you rethink and lose all hope in humanity. Kudos to Scorsese and his team for impressive research and having Osage people as creative minds on set. So we can guarantee things in the movie don't feel set up to make the white man look good or the Osage Women look different. Thank you Scorsese for not making this as an FBI perspective movie. He held it real and told the story original and detailed.DiCaprio, De Niro, Gladstone, Plemons and so many more fabulous actors did an amazing job.For me honestly this can become my all time favorite movie. I love true crime stories written well like Memories of Murder or Zodiac. The values, the personality, the message, the power & historical context is expressed clear and detailed. Killers of the Flower Moon is a 10/10.",positive
183,"This is based on true story. So all the marks are purely based on screenplay, storytelling, cinematography, score, acting and directing. This could have been easily less than 3 hours movie. Cinematography felt forced and some scenes were too long that they made no sense. Score was okayish. There were so many characters that it was hard to follow who is who and who're they referring to. So, storytelling was also okayish. Directing was good but I've seen better and you'd expect better from Martin. Acting was great. The whole cast is amazing and everyone acting amazingly. I had no prior knowledge of this story but I still could predict what's coming next. There was absolutely no element of surprise. I think 7/10 is pretty generous.",positive
184,"Superior cast, where especially DiCaprio and De Niro (who by the way both have acted in so many movies of Scorsese but now for the first time together) work so well together.Superior cinematography, where the black-and-white quadratic shots give you a feeling of authenticity.Superior score, which is not in-your-face but rather builds tension in a subtle way.Superior story telling, which lets you get invested in the story very easily and lets you forget that the movie is over three hours long.In conclusion this movie is simply superior to me! It easily ranks among my most favourite Scorsese movies!",positive
185,"Even a great recipe with the best ingredients can be ruined by baking the cake too long.Tale of historic criminality and racial injustice against a backdrop of unbridled greed. The Osage Nation forced into reservation on scrub land in Oklahoma only to find it contains large petroleum reserves. Suddenly Jed Clampett rich the naive Native Americans are set upon by every huckster and con man and a family of souless murderers who marry into and ingratiate themselves into the Osage Nation to gain access to the oil money by any means possible. Wives, husbands, inlaws, children and investigators are murdered, by knife, gun, poison and dynamite. Several of the would be killers balk until they are told the targets are ""Indians."" Local law enforcement is indifferent and only after an incredible amount of murders does the newly formed FBI steps in. Deniro is the silver tongued, serpentine, criminal puppet master, Dicaprio his dimwit hencemen and Lilly Gladstone is magnificent as Dicaprio's long suffering, haunted wife. Her realization that the man she loves, the father of her children is a muderous fool is particularly poignant. The cast is peppered with other notable actors.The acting, casting, cinematography and production values are top shelf.Unfortunately Martin Scorsese baked the cake too slow and too long.",positive
186,"""Do you see the wolves in this picture,"" Ernest Burkhardt (Leonardo DiCaprio) reads aloud as he works his way through a children's book early in Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon."" The wolves aren't really hidden at all, and they won't be in the film that follows either, a masterful historical drama about evil operating in plain sight. One of the most disturbing things about Scorsese's ambitious adaptation of David Grann's non-fiction book of the same name is how little of its vile behavior stays in the shadows. This is the story of men who treated murder almost mundanely, issuing orders to have people killed like they would order a drink at the bar. Scorsese walks that fine line between telling a very specific story of a couple at the heart of a tragedy and commenting on the larger nature of evil. The wolves in ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" don't hesitate to think that what they're doing might be wrong as long as it profits them in the end.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.With powerful performances, truly terrific production design, and outstanding cinematography. Collectively it all works to tell a gripping and heartbreaking story about greed, corruption, and entitlement. Simply put, it's one of the year's best films.",positive
187,"I want to start off by saying that I love Scorsesee movies. I've watched The Irishman 3 times even though many people found it too long. But man oh man was Flowers drawn out! I'm almost ashamed to say that during the first 2 hours, I checked my phone to look at the time. I think this movie could have been cut to 2-2.5 hours w/o losing anything. Once the FBI gets involved at the 2 hr mark, things pick up and I never looked at the time again. The actress who played Molly was excellent! DiCaprio and DeNiro were fine, not their best imo. Plemmons, Lithgow, and Fraser were also good in their respective roles. Idk...I read the book and was really looking forward to see how Scorcesse was transform it into a movie and was left underwhelmed.",positive
188,"Martin Scorcese 3hr26minute movie Killers of the Flower Moon based on the book written by David Grann is about Osage county and Indian tribe in 1920s. The depiction of lack of trust and suspiciousness and not wanting white people amongst them is excellent. Robert De Niro , a well respected white man William Hale because of his caring nature and kindness towards osage people , is terrific as always. Leonardo DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart is awesome. Ernest, back from the war where he worked as a cook for soldiers is a simple man who is not well read and just likes to spend his time with any kind of women red, white or... and drink alcohol. Ernest gives rides to locals and consistently gives rides to Mollie, one of Osage women. Lily Gladstone as Mollie is excellent. William Hale addressed as ""king"" by Ernest plants idea in Ernest about relationship with Mollie. Simple Ernest takes a liking to Mollie and their relationship based on love leads to marriage. Evil has many expressions and Ernest is all caught up with his respect for King and his ignorance of all that can happen and made to happen for greed. The scenes where William is getting to know Ernest and educating Ernest about red people , the scenes when Ernest tries to convince Osage girl Mollie why Insulin is better than all Indian medicine are directed extremely well. Mollie is great in each and every scene and her question to Ernest"" what did you give me"" in a soft voice , full of love and accusation , is Oscar worthy. Great movie. Excellent Direction. Excellent acting by Leonardo Di Caprio as a loving husband ignorant of the results of his actions and blind respect for the educated , sophisticated and wealthy William Hale. Lily Gladstone is a terrific actress with great emotional display at the loss of her sisters and mom , very girlish when in love and when with Ernest, calm and composed when speaking to authority. Oscar worthy movie. Editing is excellent. Direction is great. ( 3hrs 26 min ...did not look at my watch...)",positive
189,"The book by David Grann is a 10/10. Unfortunately what made the book so good was that it was a murder mystery, with more and more strange murders occurring culminating with the twist reveal at the end that Hal was the ring leader, Ernest was a part of his plan and Molly had no idea. This isn't a spoiler for the movie as we know this from the beginning.The movie is more like a classic Scorsese gangster movie. It felt like a large fresco with many things happening to get a feeling of the bigger picture but ended up being a bit of a mess with a weakened emotional impact.Watching a movie for over 2.5 hours is torture no matter how good it is. This was 3.5 hours!! It seemed like halfway between a tv show and movie, which is not a good thing. So either cut the fat and streamline the story and make a movie or flesh it out a little more and make a tv show. But I am never going to the cinema again to watch a movie that long again.",positive
190,"Idk, perhaps all this critics and I saw different movies. Tbh I will say this movie is beautifully shot by Prieto, with good performances but with a poor narrative construct. Mollie (Gladstone) and Ernst (DiCaprio) is recusable as a couple but there is no urgency, no opposition in telling the story this way. It seems passive. The movie linger and lingers over nothing and goes nowhere. There's no tension, no real story. As a story I could tell it in a paragraph. For a 3 hours + that goes nowhere from a huge budget and Scorsese, DeNiro and DiCaprio is a sham. I'm sorry to say cuz I love the 3 of them dearly specially Marty. It just hurt me the amount of brown noser desease here. Is overly dull and boring.People are saying the trial is good, well the trial is something as before there is nothing. I like 3 hour + movies (Babylon) I like 4 hour movies (Eureka) I like 9 hour movies (Filipino family) but this 3 hours felt so unnecessary. In one word. Pointless plot.",neutral
191,"Leaving the theater after watching Killers of the Flower Moon, I can honestly say it's been a long while since I felt this ecstatic leaving a cinema. This film might just have catapulted itself to the top of my Scorsese tier list, an impressive feat considering I hold Goodfellas in the highest regard as one of the greatest movies ever made. The performances by Lily Gladstone, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Robert De Niro were exceptional, leaving an undeniable impact that unquestionably deserves recognition.Lily Gladstone's performance in particular was profoundly moving and utterly amazing. She stole the show for me. I was genuinely moved by her performance, and I wholeheartedly hope she sweeps the Oscars next year, as she undeniably delivered one of the most outstanding performances of the year.And then there's Leonardo DiCaprio, a virtuoso in the world of acting. His portrayal in this movie is simply mesmerizing, adding another feather to his cap of extraordinary performances. It's remarkable how he consistently delivers stellar performances; from the charismatic Calvin Candie in Django Unchained to the ambitious Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street, and the rugged frontiersman Hugh Glass in The Revenant. In Killers of the Flower Moon, he once again proves his mettle. One of the best actors of our time, and also up there with Daniel Day-Lewis as one of my favorite actors of all time.While I hope DiCaprio secures another nomination for Best Actor next year, he is probably not going to win. Cillian Murphy's portrayal as the titular character in Oppenheimer is basically perfection. Even if the Academy decides yet again to not give DiCaprio an Oscar, his performance in Killers of the Flower Moon still reaffirms his status as one of the finest actors of our generation.While I understand the criticisms regarding the film's long duration, personally, it didn't matter to me. (Also considering my favorite movie of all time is Return of the King, you can probably guess that I don't mind long movies) The immersive experience and the chance to fully engage with the story made every minute worthwhile. Killers of the Flower Moon offered a journey I embraced wholeheartedly, and the extended three and a half hour duration only enriched the film's depth and impact in my opinion.Killers of the Flower Moon is not just a film to me; it stands as a testament to the art of storytelling and the mastery of filmmaking. This might not only well be Scorsese's best picture, but also one of the greatest movies of all time. Killers of the Flower Moon is a cinematic masterpiece, a work of art that definitely will stand the test of time.",neutral
192,"Martin Scorsese never misses a beat; when he chooses a theme, he goes for the jugular. What a beautiful story, so well told.This film moves you to the core. Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro at their best, and Lily Gladstone shone on her own. Additionally, they are accompanied by a long list of stars: Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, Brendan Fraser, the great Blues musician Charlie Musselwhite, other musicians like Jack White (White Stripes), Pete Yorn, and Vince Giordano with a cameo from Martin Scorsese himself.This is true cinema; with this film, Martin puts a tombstone on the so-called superhero cinema. This is cinema, impactful stories that change your life, stories that surprise you, and, in the end, you are a different person than at the beginning. It doesn't let you measure time.Based on a sad true story of greed and prejudice. Definitely a must-watch. Give the Oscar to Martin already... again. Wonderful film, this is cinema.",neutral
193,"Killers of the Flower Moon is one of the very best books I have ever read. Consequently, I was pleased to Iearn years ago that it had been optioned by Scorsese and looked forward to the finished product. I may be misremembering but I thought the initial intention was to film it as a limited series. Unfortunately, the finished product is far too long and quite poorly edited. Additionally, an inexplicable decision was made to mess with perfection and completely invert the focus and propulsion of the source material. I had to wait to screen it at home as I could not physically sit through something this long in a theater without an intermission. On the plus side, this allowed me to yell at the screen whenever I felt compelled to do so in the privacy of my own living room.I cannot recall any previous DiCaprio performance that I did not enjoy. Perhaps this one is the exception that proves the rule. He is woefully miscast and makes some very distracting choices. For example, the visage he adopted continually reminded me of the village idiot character who appeared in numerous Monty Python sketches. The original plan to cast him as the lead FBI investigator would have been a much better fit. But then the screenplay was rewritten and he switched to Ernest - a truly disastrous decision that contributes massively to the failure of the film..
My 7/10 rating is for the elements that do work exceptionally well: the cinematography, set design, and soundtrack. Beyond that, I consider the film a missed opportunity to present a shameful moment in American history in a meaningful and memorable way.",neutral
194,"The movies is showing how the current world regime is really working and who is playing with us as puppies.This movie was a masterpiece! It was so powerful and moving. Scorsese captured the essence of this tragic event with his vision and style. DiCaprio and De Niro gave incredible performances as they portrayed their complex roles as victims, suspects, and investigators. The music was haunting and emotional. The movie also had a stunning cinematography that showed the beauty and the brutality of the Osage landscape. The movie was not only a historical drama, but also a commentary on the nature of evil and the consequences of greed. It made me think about how history can repeat itself, and how we can learn from our mistakes. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen.",neutral
195,"This duration was not necessary, but In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.",neutral
196,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a new historical crime drama directed, written and produced in part by Martin Scorsese, director of Goodfellas and Taxi Driver.When oil is discovered in Osage land in Oklahoma in the 1920s, their people receive the oil rights. William Hale (Robert De Niro) tries to help and advise the Osage tribe with their rich find. For example, he tries to involve his nephew Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio). Through this, Ernest meets Mollie (Lily Gladstone) of the Osage tribe and they fall in love and get married together.When more and more people from the Osage tribe are murdered, the fledgling FBI comes in to investigate the murders. This investigation is led by Tom White (Jesse Plemons), who believes he has discovered a suspicious link.This film is based on the book of the same name by writer David Grann. After Martin Scorsese read this book, he wanted to adapt it into a film. To do this, he had hours of consultation with Chief Standing Bear of the Osage tribe to help him make this film. In this way, he tries to incorporate the history and cultures of the Osage tribe into his film in the right, respectful ways. This film can come across as a historical documentary about the Osage tribe. Martin Scorsese, together with the other screenwriter Eric Roth, manage to convey the story in such an interesting way. The film tells a story about true history that deserves to be discussed more publicly, so that it is not forgotten by future generations.Together with photography director Rodrigo Priesto, he also conveys the film in an appropriate, respectful manner. It almost seems as if they take you as a viewer into history in a time machine, to let you experience the story surrounding the Osage murders for yourself.In addition to consulting with Chief Standing Bear to film the story of the Osage tribe, Scorsese also receives help from the Osage tribe, who also play roles in the film. Actress Lily Gladstone also comes from a similar background. In this way she knows how to provide credible and appropriate acting. She acts well, even without using many words and only showing what is going through her character's mind with facial expressions. Leonardo DiCaprio also provides suitable acting, as a character who seems to be between two different worlds. In this way he tries to remain faithful to his uncle, but later also to his wife. The two are sometimes just the opposite of each other, so he has to find a way to keep both sides balanced. Robert De Niro actually plays more of a wolf in sheep's clothing in this film. He tries to appear as a friend of the Osage tribe, but secretly also tries to obtain the oil rights of their people.",neutral
197,"I'm usually not someone who complains about film length. If a movie is good time passes effortlessly. Think Schindlers list, or for that matter Titanic.This movie went into the ""I think it's dragging"" zone with me. In fact even when I felt it wasn't dragging, the story seemed just average. Great acting and technical aspects can only take a movie so far.A couple other aspects I didn't care for is DiCarios character development. Was he a bad guy the entire movie? Was he a good guy being duped ? I'm still not clear and it wasn't clear to the others with me. Why did it take what seemed so long for the Osage to realize they were being killed off ?",positive
198,"The movie impressed me by all standards.3:26h without a single boring moment.The actors were at their best, specially when we are talking about DiCaprio and De Niro.I watched two G. O. A. Ts on the screen, and they delivered their outstanding talent in that movie, specially when they were in the same scene.The music and the soundtracks were synchronized with the intensity of the story line perfectly.For me it is way better than Oppenheimer.Scorsese overtakes Nolan this year without a doubt.Definitely this is the best movie of the year.One of the best for Scorsese for sure, and will live long in the memory.",positive
199,"There's no other way to describe this film, other than just get on with it! There's really no dramatic tension because the viewer would have to be brain dead to not see the story unfolding. Don't get me wrong. The subject matter in the story is fascinating, and it opens up providing the viewer with a lot of interesting information. The problem is the story is told in a series of too many scenes that seem repetitive and meandering. Leo DiCaprio has a overstated grimace on his face the entire film (over-acting the role), Robert De Niro is a bit above average but reminisent of other bad guys he's played. Even the latter part of the movie where the FBI gets involved took forever to arrive. Just so disappointed in this slow plodding, film. It felt like Scorsese was saying to the audience, this is largely based on a true story, so I need to really go over the top with authenticity and pile on a whole bunch of scenes to qualify the point.Even the court trial at the end, there were several scenes that were redundant, providing the same info to the viewers and I kept saying please, end this movie. It just took forever to get its beats across. We get it! There was an attempted genocide of a Native American tribe, which is horrible. It's a story that should be told. But the film needed it in at least an hour and a half less time. Also, there was barley any music soundtrack in the background (ineffectual authenticity) with some parts so quiet, I could see people in the audience, checking their phones, which I don't ever see but it couldn't be helped. Because the story was so GD slow! Could have been a quasi-documentary.Oppenheimer was three hours long but it didn't feel long because the film was edited correctly and the way it was crafted made it far more interesting. Wait until KOFM becomes available for streaming, and that way you can pause it to get your second full meal, fifth beverage or go to the bathroom for the third time.No disrespect intended to the iconic Director producer or actors, but a movie that is three hours and twenty minutes long needs to earn the attention of the audience in order for them to say, yeah it was worth the time spent.",positive
200,"It is long, dark, one-dimensional and boring, from the beginning you know the ending, the novel had much more emotion. The story it tells does not need that much length, it is a great disappointment and even more so after having read all those unfounded praises from some critics. The lighting and cinematography options are vulgar, there is nothing that stands out. The actors are not directed, Robert De Niro plays Robert De Niro once again, Leonardo DiCaprio is past and out of the film, only Lily Gladstone provides some authenticity and with one look she devours her companions on the screen.Martin Scorsese has made very good films but this is not one of them.",positive
201,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is one of those increasingly rare cinematic events that are dwindling from our terminably online culture. I'm so glad I got to see it in the theater, and I urge y'all to take the time to do the same. Three-and-a-half hours, and I couldn't find a suitable time to go to the bathroom, it all seems so imperative to witness. No fat whatsoever. It is one of the great achievements in film-making.It is important to note that this is one of the most tender and genuine attempts by a white filmmaker to express even a little bit of the Indigenous experience WITHOUT resulting in a ""white savior"" narrative. Quite the opposite. Scorsese centers the white criminal conspiracy, because that's what he's always done. ""Goodfellas"" , ""Casino"" and ""Wolf of Wall Street"" (My Top 3 Scorsese, until now, maybe....) show us how the bad guys are exciting, exalted in America, even if they do eventually downfall, kinda. We follow Burkhart and Hale (and Hill, Belfort, Rothstein, Santoro, Bickle, Costello, etc.) because WE are these characters, killing out of love, covering our tracks, enjoying the spoils, panicking as the walls close in, escaping justice. These murderers died in their own beds, and those who did worse are celebrated.Lily Gladstone deserves an Oscar for her gorgeous, anchoring grace, which is systematically dismantled. We breathe a sigh of relief every time we see her face in its glorious beauty, and are heartbroken to see her harmed. It reminded me of Bjork in ""Dancer in the Dark"".....How Could You Do That To Her!So many of the Native actors are the highlights, but I was moved to intense tears during Yancey Red Corn's ""Warrior"" speech as Chief Bonnecastle. It was also a treat to see a childhood connection, Tatanka Means, with such a handsome, striking presence!My friend Sean turned to me halfway through the movie and said, ""There's just so much blood""! And yet, this film is very much a FLINCHING portrayal of the full, bloody truth. Of the Osage, of the Lakota, of the Chippewa, of the Nissenan, of the Navajo, of the Cheyenne, etc, etc, etc, and on and on..... If the white men in this film were portrayed realistically, as the rabid racists they absolutely were, we would never be able to look at DeNiro and DiCaprio the same again. Scorsese flinches at this reality, even makes it a joke (Yes, sadly, even I found myself laughing, and then noticing....heck, we'll still laugh at a racist joke, won't we?) BUT (?) he calls himself out in the final moments of the film; a brilliant, almost direct-address, condemnation of the True Crime fetishization of Indigenous suffering. The cinematic poetry of this film is anything but subtle. Just because Scorsese made this film as lovingly as he could, he admits that he is still the product of hundreds of years of bloodshed, which continues today, and will continue tomorrow. Can we ever atone if we never truly face the truth of our many Genocides?""Self awareness does not absolve us of anything.""And so the conspiracy continues, around the world and in our hearts. Our allies and loved ones incapacitate us ""just to slow us down"". Our Uncles enlist us in evil ""for the good of the family"". A room full of familiar wolves stare us down and give us the support we need to do what is wrong.PLEASE go see the film as soon as you can.The Earth needs our hearts to crack open constantly.And the Osage still dance.",positive
202,"136 minutes of telling a man that your uncle told you to tell him to tell someone else to do something, and that you can't tell them yourself because you don't know what they look like, and have no established bond or relationship with them, but they have to be told now. And they have to do the afore-unmentioned thing good and soon.And although Leo fights a bear, and there are countless murders, it needs more 'splosions.This movie confuses length with significance. Sure it brings an important story to greater prominence... but so much is unsaid that the only way to really understand what's going on is to go read some background. That, to me, seems a significant failing.",positive

And I have to say that the real like Molly, that woman endured more than most people could have if they lived 5 lifetimes. They worked hard on this film and I felt they did a phenomenal job representing this historical story. Leonardo DiCaprio did not disappoint. The man is talented. The young woman portraying Molly was AMAZING! Robert DeNiro was pretty darn good too. There are some unexpected actors who pop in. As well as favorites from Dances with the Wolves. All in all they have a smash hit!",positive

First off this is a 3.5 hrs long torture, extremely long, SLOW grind with lose screenplay and editing. You feel that this story could have easily been told in under 90 minutes at a slightly faster pace. As it is I almost left the theater at least 3 to 4 times. The actors did a great job with the material they had, unfortunately at the end it was just a slow torture, won't be disappointed if it bombs at the box office, again Oscar nod won't surprise me as they usually get dazed by the bright lightsSuper disappointing, skip it.",positive
205,"Money moves the worldKillers of the flower moon, a film directed by Martin Scorsese, tells a story of the thriller and drama genre. It is about the real story in the 20's where there was a series of murders of the indigenous inhabitants of Osage to acquire a very precious commodity: oil.In my opinion, I found this film to be magnificent in every way and I was not bored during the three and a half hours. It is a really intense feature film where every scene adds to the story. The conversations are intelligent and realistic. The actors are a ten, especially I give emphasis to the great role of Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone, because whenever they have a dialogue they transmit all their possible truth.Also, the music and the image have matched during the story with perfect pauses and silences.The last point to highlight is the magnificent script thanks to Scorsese. You can tell he has great potential and can create art in more than three hours with a great level of intensity.The director has had the great idea to carry out this film with the criticism and reflection on how money moves the world, that is, there are people who do crazy things for interests; in this case for oil.We live in a society where quantity is preferred over quality, and once we get something we want more. This thought was already supported by the philosopher Schopenhauer who talked about desire and wanting, since when we satisfy a desire or get something we want, new desires often arise and we want more. This can be seen reflected in the actor Robert de Niro who plays the character of William Hale, with his greed focused on acquiring wealth at the cost of victims.In conclusion, I found this film to be a work of art: intense, profound, emotional and thoughtful with a spectacular script and, if you are fully attentive, you will enjoy it and time will not be a handicap.",positive
206,"So, I just came back from a screening of Killers of the Flower Moon, which surpassed The Irishman (175,000,000$), Scorsese's previous record for most expensive (somewhat) biographical film ever made, by twenty-five million dollars.Mathematically, that comes down to about a million bucks a minute of actual story; this movie has a 206' runtime, including the end credits which take well over a quarter of an hour. Not only that, but I think Thelma Schoonmaker could've easily left at least twenty minutes of filler on the cutting room floor - but that was also my opinion regarding both The Irishman and Silence, so there's that. All three just felt like needlessly spun-out, and yes, pretentious attempts at 'cinematic grandstanding' that lost sight of what movies should be all about: telling a good story well.Now, I'm not a big fan of most of those Disney/DC roller coasters either, but I think both extremes are totally, and tonally, missing that simple point.Thing is: it's an okay movie, based on a terribly fascinating piece of harrowing history, but I just don't feel it was communicated within the right kind of gritty atmosphere; if anything, Scorsese could've created a far more gripping experience if all of it hadn't looked so polished, postured, and 'perfected'. I'm not just talking about the admittedly stunning, but overly slick cinematography, but also the squeaky-clean costumes, which mostly held their anachronistically 'off-the-rack' gloss as year upon year passed by storywise. It just felt inauthentic to me - one egregious example of this is a significant Stetson hat that DiCaprio's character is gifted at the start of the movie, which doesn't even look remotely crumpled or worn far further on in the story.The acting by pretty much everyone is wonderful, though (especially Lily Gladstone, who positively obliterates DiCaprio), as are the soundtrack and often witty, powerful dialogues, but the overall pacing and character development, to me, felt way off - which made an already long movie feel like an even longer slog to get through (kinda like this run-on sentence). To top it all off, without spoiling too much, it all ends in a weirdly incongruent coda that felt both tacky and tacked on, concluding in a bloviating self-insert by Mister Director, which positively reeked of shameless narcissism.That being said: I don't think this is a bad movie at all - but still. Two hundred million dollars? This should've been a full-blown masterpiece, and it's decidedly not.",positive
207,"This is arguably Scorsese's best film. The story is told in a way you'd absolutely expect from Scorsese, this man's genius is unmatched. Outstanding cinematography, score, production design and editing, all top tier technical excellence. The performances from Lily Gladstone and Leonardo DiCaprio are Oscar worthy feats, but for me, Robert De Niro was the clear standout best. I've never seen him act so menacingly evil and kindhearted at the same time, it's amazing.A lot has been said about the runtime, which honestly I think is a very unfair criticism of the film. For the caliber of story this is going for, the runtime is justified, honestly I would of liked another hour of it. If you go into it scared of a long runtime, you won't like it, but it deserves to be seen by everyone.",positive
208,"Don't listen to the raving reviews as this good, not great, 2023 film entry is a missed opportunity. What you have are many critics and Scorcese worshippers wishing it was a masterpiece, wanting it to be a masterpiece, and hoping it would've been one so their confirmation bias going in was strong as they probably thought every good scene or cinematography shot was genius.I actually really enjoyed the first hour to maybe ninety minutes of the film. It was surprisingly well paced and immersive and I questioned the reviews that said it was too slow and boring as a result of that.However, it's true that starting close to the two hour mark, the film begins to really deteriorate in quality. It's still interesting, but the brisk pace and better editing diminish, and we're left with longer, drawn out scenes and choppy editing and uneven storytelling that in hindsight should've been reduced in time, edited, and had scenes cut out.As if the second act didn't already reduce the momentum of the first hour or ninety minutes, then we get to the two and a half hour mark and an almost lifeless investigator arrives and pursues the case like he's playing marbles by himself on the table, with no energy, insightful reasoning, or inclination for hard justice. He's just monotoned and a cardboard cutout. It's more like a cameo. Still, the story is so interesting that the film is still watchable despite how uninvigorated the takedown is. There is very little suspense for the third act of a crime thriller about organized crime, which is truly a head scratcher, and here is where (one of the places where) the film truly fails. The other places it fails is in a lack of twists or surprises and in a lack of character development (although it does have some character development, which is much better than none that most movies have nowadays).Finally, we get to a truly bizarre final scene, which shockingly sinks the film once and for all. The final scene is not brilliant, it's not profound, and it's utterly misplaced and disappointing. It shared nothing new that we didn't already know, and any extractions of meaning on the setup could've been better told or explained in other ways.Acting is very good, especially DeNiro, but Dicaprio never fully reaches greatness here, another underwhelming character range from him, and Plemons just doesn't seem to know what he's doing. Frasier's brief appearance was more like a comedy gag, and Lithgow wasn't in long either, as he's relegated to only a couple of courtroom scenes.It's a very flawed, but solidly made, movie that does have a very intriguing story, but you can't help but feel that despite all its entertainment values, it could've been told and handled better.One of the first things you say when a movie finishes to measure its' value and likability is whether you would ever watch it again, whether rent or on cable, and I honestly don't think this movie has any rewatch value because there are no scenes that stand out and it lacks powerful suspense that creates entertainment value. There is a masterpiece sonewhere in this crazy story of the Osage tribe crime case; it's just not in this particular telling of it.The story has huge potential to be a great movie, but this version of it is only fair, with solid and good technical components. It should've been edited down to 2 hours and 15 to 30 minutes and added some surprises. For example, how satisfying and awesome would it have been if Molly had put two and two together by the fifth time Ernest enters, when she says, ""you're next"", if she pulled a big gun out from under the sheet and blew him away? So we know that's not what happened in real life, but suppose he miraculously survives that and the true story reconnects from there. Instead, we get a sort of vanilla Scorcese tale with no real climactic moments or jaw dropping scenes. Here's another idea- imagine Tom White, Plemons, does his fingerprint investigation or does a masterfully acted, intense interrogation scene, or imagine he sneaks up on Ernest and doesn't take no for an answer to enter the house. Give him a warrant or something, just anything to increase tension, so the audience has something to remember about the four hour overly long runtime. I say four because between previews, credits, driving, and parking it's even longer than the three, twenty-six when you factor it all in. And at home, you'll be rewinding scenes because some actors speak with indecipherable accents or poor pronunciation of key words and names.A good movie, but not a great one.6/10.",positive
209,"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",positive
210,"Whenever you see the name ""Martin Scorsese"" in a movie, there is only one thing you have to do. Watch it. For so many decades, Martin Scorsese is the name that guarantees the quality of a movie. Every movie of him is a full element of cinema, a perfect picture of art, and an enjoyable movie experience. Scorsese is famous for the mobster theme, New York streets, and a person's inner life. Probably, you may have heard or watched ""Goodfellas,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull"", ""Gangs of New York,"" ""The Departed,"" ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" and ""The Irishman."" Those are only some notable movies of Scorsese, but they are epic movies that create the trademark of Martin Scorsese. You don't need to worry about his movies because they are the best. His movies are not targeting the box office element. It is more about the cinematic and artistic. It is no surprise that Scorsese strongly criticized superhero movies and called them an ""amusement park."" I cannot agree more. With him, the film is not only for entertainment. It is also about the beauty of cinema, showing the audience that the film has voices and weight and reflects society. Cinema is his passion and his life.In 2023, Scorsese returns with a new movie based on a true story called Killers of the Flower Moon. It is an experience that you never forget. The film is the collaboration of two actors, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, who are Scorsese's leading stars. DiCaprio and De Niro used to be in two movies together, but this is the first time they collaborated in a Scorsese film. And the funny thing is that they both played villains. Killers of the Flower Moon is a horrific true story that happened in the 20th century. Members of the Osage Native American tribe of Osage County, Oklahoma, are murdered after oil is found on their land. Since the police didn't investigate their deaths, the FBI stepped in and brought the truth to light. With members of the Native American tribe, the tragedy in Osage County is a pain they will never forget. Author David Grann wrote the book and told exactly what happened when everything was forgotten or washed away. Under the hands of Scorsese, Killers of the Flower Moon is brought to the big screen, and there is nothing to complain about this movie. He understood the assignment, did his best to recreate a tragedy, and exposed its truth. There was a story that when DiCaprio first read the script, he realized it was told from the view of a white person, and that would not work for this movie. Scorsese immediately changed the hand, and what you see right now in the theater is the final version. Paramount spent $200 million on this movie to help Scorsese fulfill his creativity and his vision because when a project lands in his hands, there will be no wrong.When making a movie about a different culture, which the director is not a part of, they will do much research and reach out to the people of that culture to make sure that the movie can be as realistic as possible and be able to tell the correct story and show the value of the culture. Killers of the Flower Moon is very respectful to the Native American culture and authentic in portraying their culture. Scorsese did the best job of showing most realistically the Native American culture at that time and recreating the horror of what they had been through. The setting of Killers of the Flower Moon took place in the 1920s, and it was very beautiful. The outfits are correct with the traditional dress of the Native Americans. With 3 hours and 26 minutes, the audience will fall into every single corner of the story in the whole detail. Many people complained about the length of this movie. But I will say, ""F-ck off."" There is nothing called too long in the Scorsese film. Whenever he does a movie, he will do his best to honor the original story to make sure every angle will be brought out. If the movie lasts less than 2 hours, it will be nothing. Then, you can complain. But this is a true story based on a tragedy. The audience must know the truth and understand what happened after watching this movie. So, if you plan to watch Killers of the Flower Moon, fasten your seatbelt; it will be a bumpy ride.When it comes to DiCaprio and De Niro, you don't need to put your expectations high because they will amaze you with their performance and only good performance. This time, they played greedy white men who wanted the money of the Native Americans in Osage County since they owned a golden oil land. White men in Osage County married Native American women and killed them for their fortune. Not only women but other men were also killed. Then, no one investigated this case until the FBI. DiCaprio played Ernest Burkhart, who had just returned from the Great War and settled in Osage County, where his uncle William King Hale, played by De Niro, ruled the place and made money on the blood and flesh of the Native Americans. Burkhart followed his uncle's order and married Mollie Burkhart, played by Lily Gladstone, whose sisters and other relatives died mysteriously and suspected they were murdered, but they could not do anything. Tragedies after tragedies brought the misery to a climax. Two great actors did a great job portraying evil men and brought out the cruelty and greed of the characters. The audience will be afraid of them. They showed no remorse or regret after what they did. They have blood on their hands. Seeing DiCaprio and De Niro in a Scorsese movie together is incredible. But the true star of this movie is Lily Gladstone. She played a Native American woman who witnessed the deaths of her sisters, mother, and fellows. The desperation of Mollie Buckhart was described in the best way possible to show the audience the darkest history of Native Americans in the 20th century. She is truly a rising star, and there is no doubt that she will earn herself an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in the Leading Role next year. Besides the main cast, the supporting cast did an incredible job in this movie.Killers of the Flower Moon is the best movie of 2023. Seeing Martin Scorsese still has a strong passion for cinema makes me emotional because I have watched most of his films and understood how much he loves cinema and wants to continue contributing to the cinema. Before the film begins, you will see Martin Scorsese saying a few words to show his appreciation to you when spending your time watching his movie and telling you how this movie is important. Only a true master of cinema can do it. Killers of the Flower Moon is playing in theaters. Highly recommend!",positive
211,"The vast number of murders of Native Americans in David Grann's book surely presented a problem for transferring this first ""FBI"" case to the screen. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter come close to solving the complexity issue by focusing almost entirely on the DeNiro character's treachery in drawing his nephew (DiCaprio) into marrying an Osage woman, with the long range plot to acquire her family's huge oil rights fortune. The reality, which is only suggested and referred to here and there, is that many other men besides this sheriff (!!) and his possibly somewhat duped nephew, were also killing off their own spouses and relatives to acquire similar fortunes.For over two hours this movie is riveting, and we know we're in the hands of a master. The three leads give their careers a huge upward leap. DeNiro and DiCaprio have seen heights like this many times before, but Lily Gladstone charts very new territory in presenting a clever, witty and heroic portrayal of an Osage woman on the screen.But the abrupt shift of the tone, in which the courtroom and jail scenes are staged near the end, makes it seem (to me) as if we've entered a different movie. Despite the bluster of John Lithgow and Brendan Fraser, the trial scenes seem perhaps to have been rushed or weakly developed. But the bulk of the material before these scenes is so well done and involving that a lapse like this can easily be ignored.Scorsese brings the movie to a close with a couple of brave choices: a scene of a radio studio broadcast, and a final overhead shot of a tribal ritual dance that is stunning to see. Most excellent movie.",positive
212,"The movie describes itself as a psychological drama... well, I think drama is a better representation.At 3hr 26m this is a very long movie, and given its very slow pace, unfortunately after about 1hr 45m it begins to tell. The 1st act is good, followed by a reasonable 2nd act but then the finale which lasted way too long, and the ending, OMG, the last 10 mins was actually very poor, indeed almost silly.Dealing with such an important subject matter, I am not entirely sure why this was done.. but that being said, Lily Gladstone, and Robert De Niro will surely be given an Oscar nod.Overall, I guess I am happy I saw it, though, it would have been better in the comfort of a nice sofa!",positive
213,"The BankofMarquis would highly recommend you see the latest epic (and we do mean EPIC) film from famed Director Martin Scorsese in a movie theater. Not because of the beautiful Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, not because of the Epic-ness of the tale told and not because movie theaters could use your business (all of which are reasons to see it in the movie theaters). You need to see KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON in a movie theater so that you cannot be distracted by things around you (most, notably your PHONE). One needs to immerse themselves in the experience of this 3 1/2 movie to totally understand and appreciate it.And that is because KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is as much atmosphere, mood and setting as it is story. Early on, one of the characters warns another one that the Osage people (the central group in this story) ""don't say much, listen more and let long pauses hang between words"" and Scorsese does much of the same. Letting the story hang - and be told in - the silence between the words. And it works...if you are paying attention.Starring Scorsese regulars Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert DeNiro and featuring a wonderful, soon-to-be-Oscar-Nominated performance by newcomer Lily Gladstone, KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is based on the novel of the same name by David Gann and tells the tale of the Osage Nation who discover oil on their land in the 1920's and the white men who come to try to connive and steal it away from them.Taken on the surface, this story could be a pretty straight-forward white-man steals from the Indians story (substitute Buffalo for Oil and we have a story told so many times before - most notably in the Oscar winning movie DANCING WITH WOLVES), but in the hands of master craftsman Scorsese, this movie is much, much more than that.Easily his best work in at least 10 years, Scorsese lets this story breathe and focuses in on the mood and atmosphere of the period - and the disparate people that inhabit...and battle for...this land and oil. It is the work of a maestro nearing the end of his tenure, skillfully conducting the Orchestra, one last, loving, magnificent time.Like Scorsese, this is Oscar winner Robert DeNiro's best performance in years and will not be surprised if he garners his first Oscar nomination in many, many years. Gone are the histrionics and over-the-top gestures and facial ticks that mar his comedic work (and in some cases his non-comedic work). DeNiro returns to the compact, internal ""method"" acting that was the hallmark of his early (best) work. You can see that this player still has ""game"" and he gives the role of William ""King"" Hale some dimension. This is good for this character could have, in lesser hands, turned into a ""mustache-twirling"" villain tying the heroine to the railroad tracks but in DeNiro's capable hands (with Scorsese skillfully leading him) it is so much more.Speaking of the Heroine, newcomer Lily Gladstone is just a strong and compact in her portrayal of Mollie Burkhart - the Osage woman in the center of the story. She gives Lily some sharp edges along with the rounded corners she is given in the script and the story and more than holds her own with the likes of DeNiro and DiCaprio in the many, many scenes she has with them. Most of the time, she needs to express quite a bit with a look or silence (while looking away) and she is able to convey that very, very well.Fairing less well in this film is Leonardo DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart, the sad-sack that is the pawn of ""King"" Hale and the love interest of Lily...or is he? DiCaprio is very good as Burkhart (when has he ever given a bad performance) but this character is thinly written and you can almost see the puppet strings on him. This, probably, is on purpose by Scorsese...but against two solid characters like DeNiro's ""King"" Hale and Gladstone's Molly, there just needed to be a bit more to DiCaprio's character to make him more interesting.Since this is a Scorsese film, it is fleshed out by some wonderful character actors led by the always watchable Jesse Plemons as the FBI agent sent to unpack what is going on. Joining him in what are (essentially) extended cameos are John Lithgow, newly minted Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, the always good Tantoo Cardinal, Scott Shepherd (as Leo's brother) and a myriad of ""that guy"" and ""interesting looking roughnecks"" to flesh the feel of the film out - both on the white man as well as the Osage sides of the story.The aforementioned Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto along with the Costuming (Jacqueline West), Production Design (Jack Fisk) and Score (Robbie Peterson) all add to the mood of the piece and makes it very successful, indeed.Just be forewarned, it is as every bit of 3 1/2 hours as it's runtime dictates. There will be long, slow, silent parts that will make you tempted to pick up your phone - but resist that and enjoy the epic mood piece that is KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON. You won't regret it.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis).",positive
214,"It should be ended in 2hr. Most of the scene is unnecessary. De Niro character is boring and lack of leadership chrisma , this has to be the worst performance Decaprio did. Decaprio most of the facial expressions is frown in this show,Gladstone deliver a power performance but lack of chemistry with Decaprio. I no mind longer movie ,I can watch Oppenheimer 2 to 3 time without feeling bored with it's rich content story telling but this is way too long and most of the scene didn't link with the story at all. Wish to see more performance from Osage tribe supporting cast since this story is about them. Still a watchable movie ,too much room for improvement.",positive
215,"This was a great watch. The cinematic quality, cast, depth of character development over the 3+ hours was fantastic. Worth the time and effort unless you find history uncomfortable. Side note what a cast.Living in a country with its own historical challenges as a commonwealth of England the shear wrongs that occurred for First Nations makes our story so much easier to digest. Not that we got it right but we got it so much less wrong is that makes sense.Take a look at Wind River to understand my point. This might have been the 1920's but it would seem not much has changed in regards to the US caring about its indigenous people.",positive
216,"If you're going into this film expecting it to be a great gripping story with loads of intense scenes and excitement, like most Scorsese films are, you will be disappointed. There isn't even a good song in the entire 3.5 hours. Obviously this film is beautiful, it's well made, well acted and with no technical ""flaws"", that's what great directors do. This film is also absent of any thrills, any excitement and frankly, any emotion. I can happily enjoy a 3+ hour film, including many of Director Scorsese's, but this is not one. I did learn some new things about a piece of American history. Go see it. Give it your own thought and time, but don't have your hopes up.",positive
217,"It's a long movie but it seemed to go fairly quickly. When you understand what's happening. If your into a little history. It has many great actors and actresses. I kinda feel it was Dumb Bunter Xi-Den in this movie! LololAnywhoo, it really sets the pace on a time when Indians themselves become the richest in the old Wild West. Only the greed, corruption, tragedies that come with new found riches they had handlers. Sad. If you follow up on this movie about the Osage Indians. Those families down to their children. Based on true events. It's just sad.J Edgar Hoovers First FBI case. And it's quite interesting. Glad they got the help when the did. And treated with respect and protection back than.Indians have had to be so restricted even, today. Are the ones that deserve reparations. Just saying.It's a great movie! The people that are ctmryung about the length. Don't like historical events. Would find this movie boring. I just wished towards the end had more people information about what happened to them afterwards. We looked it up. -",positive
218,"I like the story, love the Osage even the face off beaten puppy presented by DiCaprio for half of the movie. Obviously it was too long, i feel like the introduction to the story could 've been 2 times shorter. Some people left the theater early, but Ive stayed and Im glad I did. Greed, corruption and money more than life. Its the story about manipulation, love (or love for money, but its still some kind of love, isn't it?), broken trust, pain and fear of being in your own home. I like how all the loud noises are incorporate in the movie in a way that itll caught you off guard, its such a contrary to the stoic posture of Mollie Borkheart. So if you are patient enough for the story to build slowly, go watch it. :)",positive
219,"I'll start off by saying that I wanted to be pleasantly surprised by this film and so I never watched any of the lengthier trailers, just the initial teasers.I was somewhat aware of what the plot was about, but what I wasn't prepared for, was just how incredibly dull, overhyped and drawn out this film was.There are several aspects to the storytelling that made this film so atrocious that I considered walking out several times - something I've never done in my entire life.First off, the subject matter is dark, grim and vile. The crimes behind this tale are obviously reprehensible, but also took place over 100 years ago. So retelling them now feels like a reach for Scorsese to tell a story that has a more significant audience in todays world. Absent an entertaining or stylized approach, this was Scorsese's attempt at capturing the dollars behind modern day outrage against the history of America. There is no shortage of that after 2020.What made this film specifically hard to watch is the combination of a dull storyline that emphasizes the crimes but doesn't add any dressing to the story. Any sliver of humor that was there falls flat. The dialogue is so plain and straightforward that even when they retell stories of murder it just comes off as shocking and repulsive in a way that an informative movie that ISNT a documentary shouldn't. If that is the intent, then that begs the question, why was this movie marketed as something more than that? The trailer implies humor, and drama worth telling. Not to simply stoke the anger of Native Americans who's ancestors faced this kind of evil.Overall the old timey music, poor character development, lack of humor, and excessively lengthy runtime made for an INCREDIBLY unenjoyable film. The Irishman might have been the sign that Scorsese is past his good days. If he hung it up after The Departed he would have held his head high, alas with this heaping pile of trash he forgoes that option.",positive
220,"When a great director makes a new film it will always be compared to his other works. Killers of the Flower Moon never hits the heights of Goodfellas, The Departed, or The Wolf of Wall Street though it is better other stellar films like The Aviator, The Irishman, and Gangs of New York (and yes I know I am omitting extremely highly regarded films like Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, among others, from this list). There is no getting away from the runtime. 200 minutes is a lot of time to invest in a film though long films are often the best films and this one is worth its runtime, though this is a brutal 200 minutes of film. The long runtime and bleak subject matter hamper it's re-watchability.The film is beautifully and skillfully done. The acting is superb. The thing that keeps this film from greatness is the lack of levity. The film has little humor, though perhaps there is no place for humor in the story. Still, there are no moments I will particularly remember about the film. There is no scene akin to ""you think I'm funny"" scene from Goodfellas that transcends the film.Killers of the Flower Moon is a powerful story and worth the watch, though not a film I expect many to enjoy or love.",positive
221,"This movie held my attention for its entire 3.5 hours. That said, however, I would not go to see it in a movie theater again, whereas I have seen Oppenheimer three times in theaters and been spell-bound all three times.The good in this movie, for me, was the sometimes striking cinematography, and the performance by Lily Gladstone in the female lead. I found both di Caprio and de Niro's performances more like caricature than drama, and that sometimes grated on me.There were things I didn't like as well, however.First, for a movie that is supposed to provide understanding for the Osage, and Native Americans in general, I was bothered that by far the majority of the screen time was devoted to the underhanded machinations of the Anglos. It would have seemed a lot fairer, and more interesting, to me to have had regular extended scenes with the Osage talking among themselves. The plotting of the Anglos to get their money was all pretty obvious and could therefore have been considerably condensed to make room for more scenes with the Osage. Yes, that would have reduced the roles of the two big draws, di Caprio and de Nero, but they could still have been listed as the leads.Second, I really hated the trivialization caused near the end with the switch to the G-Men radio show to present what happened to the characters. I don't know if that show was as hokey as it is in this movie, but the shift from drama to that was jarring and distancing.Finally, while some of the scenes with Osage dialog are subtitled in English, not all are. It was aggravating not to know what the characters were saying.But again, the movie did hold me. And certainly the story is an important one that deserves to be told - though the comparison to the 1921 Tulsa massacre of the Black Greenwood district was stretching things. I suspect a Ken Burns documentary would satisfy me more than this fictionalized telling.",positive
222,"Synopsis: When oil is discovered in the 1920s at a land that belongs to the native Osage people, they are slowly starting to get murdered one by one. Until the FBI steps in to investigate the case.Directed by the great Martin Scorsese after 4 years since his last film The Irishmen (2019), he returns again as Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Di Niro in lead roles as well as Lilly Gladstone. The film can simply be described as a 'disappointment' at least to me personally. That does not make it a bad film, it's still a great film filled with so many positive elements, but, its negative elements surpasses the positives ones.This is DiCaprio's first leading role since his last one which was in Don't Look Up in 2021 as Dr. Randel Mindy. Before that, his leading role was in Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood in 2019 as Rick Dalton. Anyone noticed anything 'unique' or 'different' in his role in Killers of the Flower Moon comparing to the last two characters he presented? Same acting skills, same craziness that the characters has, same actions, same facial expressions, and same characteristics. This simply lowers in DiCaprio's acting skills ability as well as his choices of the roles he wants to present. Note that Leo himself decided to switch roles as he stepped in to take the role of Jesse Plemons. So DiCaprio originally was suppose to play Jesse Plemons' role which is the FBI investigator. In my opinion, this is the biggest mistake and the weakest decision that DiCaprio has ever made. I would've loved to see DiCaprio in an unusual and different character comparing to his last two ones. More importantly, would've actually loved to see Jesse Plemons in a leading role. Plemons is highly talented and can easily carry a film by himself with his ability of bringing such heavy weight on the screen. Robert Di Niro is by far the biggest surprise as many expected him to introduce something usual. This man still got it all and something that helped a lot is that he is playing a character that reflects his actual age.The film could easily be cut down to 2 hours. There is a whole hour and a half that added NOTHING to the story and had 0 support to the plot. The film contained so many scenes that felt repeated and overused.The trailers of this film tricks you into thinking that this film has a great soundtrack. The film overused that one specific piece of track that gives a very suspense vibe to the scene yet it is the only thing being heard throughout the whole 3 hours and a half of the film which made my ears truly get sick of listening it throughout the whole film and throughout each scene and sequence.The film could've (and SHOULD'VE) chosen to tell the story from the perspective of the Osage people. Or perhaps ANYONE else like the FBI detective agent and turning this into a suspense/crime/thriller film. A 3 hours and a half that truly presented nothing new, even thought I was patiently waiting for the climax to hit, until the film ended in the most cold and slow way ever.My rating is 7.5/10

The pacing is just perfect, and the script stellar - with the right amount of twists and turns, the unconventional, and visual, metaphorical cinematic language. Truly beautiful.The actors all do an incredible job, many of them legendary names, and convey this true and grim tale beautifully.Overall, simply a masterpiece, living up to its hype perfectly, one of the best films of the year!

I would have expected more from actors of this calibre, but then again they didn't have too much to work with. More about why below.6/10 story
The bulletpoints are amazing, and should have been enough for a better story. I like the theme, and the story that Martin wants to tell is both important and entertaining but for the duration this movie has, it needed much better dialogue. It's all very straight forward and simple, even the wise characters seemed simple minded and simply bad with words. The irishman was also long but so many scenes linger in my memory because of the great writing and dialogue, with great actors to deliver them. Most of the dialogue here just fell flat.6/10 overall
Many people have said it already. This could and should have been a 2 hour flick. The story itself doesn't need 3 and half hours, and if you wanna make it that long regardless you better bring your a-game when it comes to the dialogue.I don't regret paying to see it on the big screen, but no matter how much I love Marty it has to be said, this was a disappointment.",positive
225,"Anyone who's read the book about this true story had to be thinking the same thing... how do you film a murder mystery where there is no mystery, and make it dramatic? But Scorsese has done it, in spades.It's a film that flows at a leisurely pace yet manages to move the story ahead briskly. It might be described as a slow burn, with little in the way of grandiose set pieces. In fact, the only truly bombastic moment is delivered off screen. Nearly all the characterizations are fantastically conceived, with DeNiro in particular, delivering a masterful performance. Lily Gladstone, as Mollie Burkhart, is also magnificent. In an early, less circumspect time, Mollie may have been portrayed merely as victims. But the story gives Mollie and her family a fullness and richness that only enhance the empathy from the audience.It is quite a long film, but it never drags or bores. The person who wishes for <2 hour film, with the story tied up in a neat bow, must lack imagination or the desire for masterful film storytelling. And a lesser filmmaker could easily have provided that... in fact, even this film could reasonably have been cut by 30-45 minutes (mostly on the back end) and provided a satisfactory experience. But the film is so engrossing, the audience doesn't want it to end... at least myself and the audience I was with, didn't. To top it off, there is a unique and cleverly delivered epilogue to the story. And I would recommend staying through the end credits. No surprises or flourishes, but just a period for reflection and meditation, calling back to scene early in the film. Overall, a magnificent experience.",positive
226,"I was lucky enough to see this movie at a preview screening. As a big fan of Leo and a big fan of Scorsese I had an abundance of excitement to see this movie, but I left disappointed. The movie was just too long. Over 3.5 hours long and after the first hour, I did wonder, where is this movie going? There are a lot of movies who have similar storylines, cast and movie length, but this felt too long and without any real substance. There were moments where I wondered if it was a Wes Anderson movie. The cast did a great job telling the story but a real let down in terms of the high expectations that Leo sets with all of his movies. This one just felt incredibly flat. At least 1.5 hours of that movie could have been cut and it would have left a punchy, raw and incredibly well acted movie. The good acting was lost amongst the length.",positive
227,"I am not a critic, I am just another fan who wants to share his opinion regarding a movie that he really liked. To do so, I will not base myself on the real events that take place in the movie but on the movie itself.I have to start talking about the performances, in my opinion perfect for the film. As always, Leonardo Di Caprio does not disappoint at all, Robert De Niro doing as masterful as usual and Lily Gladstone stealing every second she appears on screen.Now I will talk about what I have wanted to talk about since I left the movie theater, the scenery is sublime, I have to say that I partly remembered Kubrick, more specifically his film Barry Lyndon in comparison; which Kubrick wants to show the century XVIll as a period painting, Scorsese wants to show the 20th century and along with it the life of the Osage as a photograph or rather as a negative. I want to highlight the scene of Ernest Buckhart (Leonardo Di Caprio) being reprimanded by his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro), the scenery has somber colors, well-planned decoration and an appropriate composition.The music is a perfect companion to the story as are the performances.The story told from Scorsese's point of view is a sequence of events told from the point of view of the Osage, turning into a thriller.As Scorsese characterizes, many scenes are reminiscent of his exquisite filmography so far, the court testimony scene is almost a carbon copy of the GoodFellas testimony scene, and the mourning scene in prison is very reminiscent of the scene where Henry Hill and Karen Hill cry in the corner of their room, or maybe I'm going too deep.Finally, I consider that the film is a love letter to cinema in general. Every minute of the film is worth seeing and I think that all those who worked on the film, including Scorsese, did a magnificent job. I am completely satisfied. I really don't want to go on much longer, I think that what has been said is enough.",positive
228,"I love Scorcese films and was really looking forward to Leo and Deniro and the fantastic Osage story.The pros are the DP work, sets are stunning, and the acting is top notch.Cons are 2 dimensional characters with little to no arcs and endless excessive killings and you see no benefit or change in the characters journey. The Indian women are barely given much depth and look like they are all on Prozac except the one drunk Anna whom you dish had more scenes.Otherwise the long 3.5 hi hues might work for an Apple mini series but this film really feels long winded with so many scenes of Leo injecting insulin that you wonder if the editor was madly in love with him as it's pointless and serves no purpose in moving plot/story along. By the time the fbi part starts it feels like youve watched an e tire film - then it starts to pick up more pace with a bizarre ending scene straight out of Wes Anderson movie that boggles the mind why it was inserted.Watch it with low expectations and little to drink as 3.5 hours does not fly by like OppenheimerA 6 for the acting, DP and sets -",positive
229,"It's great that yet another shameful episode of American history was told but let's hold back the praise on what another 'brilliant' Scorsese masterpiece this was. First of all, it is way too long. The story could have been told in 2 hours or less. The second half of the movie drags on needlessly.Second, there is nothing new in the storytelling. If anything, I felt like I was watching Goodfellas all over again. De Niro, as Bill Hale, virtually reprises his Jimmy Conway character in manipulating all the poor stoops working for him and knocking them off one by one. I am still waiting for Joe Pesci to turn up in a scene somewhere - maybe in a scene in the 5-hr Director's Cut.This movie is at best a mildly entertaining but too long movie that recounts a disgraceful event in history. It is far, far short of being great.",positive
230,"Another fantastic film by the greatest filmmaker alive, truly remarkable.I'm glad Marty re-wrote the script more from their POV than the novel which's is more centered around Tom White. It results in a different movie with more heart.Truly horrific story, very important for all
to know and learn more about the atrocities that were committed and the systematic racism that unfortunately in some ways still exists.Performances are top notch, particularity the main three characters, I will be shocked if they are not all nominated and likely top candidate to win all awards, even ahead of Oppenheimer.",positive
231,What a perfect movie every single detail was perfect the production design the lighting techniques costume design and particularly the cinematography was stunning . This movie is highly artistic and not for every on and this one is one the movies that audience appreciate by the time . Oscar goes to diCaprio and gladstone they were perfect in every way one of best acting perfomances in while . Being perfect by deniro is something usual deserves an oscar . Extraordinary story worth the 3.5 runtime attractive characters and good twists and well paced I enjoyed every second in this movie . Must see for everyone.,positive
232,"Not what I was expectingSo I want to say movies that are 3 hours need something to keep the audience going to keep them interested, Oppenheimer was much better at executing this than Killers of the flower moon.The story is of Ernest (Leo Dicaprio) who comes to his uncles farm after the war, his uncle is a powerful man and very rich and only wants to be richer. On the land of the Osage people the Native American woman seem to be getting married to the white man, Ernest falls for Mollie who is one of many sisters and also single. Things get heated as native Americans are getting murdered and nothing is being done. Who is doing these murders, who is safe and can Ernest handle the pressure from his uncle?First I liked the acting, Leo, De Niro and Gladstone are the stand outs by far. The sheer emotion and pain Mollie goes through is heartbreaking, she can't escape the loss. Ernest seems a bit to simple to understand what his uncle is doing, if he lived his wife as he claimed he wouldn't be taking part in horrible events. The characters are all great, so is the score and the visuals.My main problem, the pacing, a 3 and a half hour movie needs something to pull the audience along, for me this didn't, we know who is behind the killings, we know what the motives are, there is no ""major"" scenes or explosive acting scenes either to be like oh wow, what's going to happen, it's too predictable. Oppenheimer was intense and had a feeling of dread, this had only loss, not enough to want to keep going.De Niro is probably a take away, a normal villain done extremely well, not a wolf in sheep's clothing but an actual snake, slithering among the prey. Good acting but too slow, no spark for me, could have been 2hr 30, 7/10.",positive
233,"I first became aware of this fascinating and haunting tale when I came across David Grann's book of the same name when it was first released and included it in my to read list. It was a pleasant surprise to find out years later that the book was going to be adapted on the silver screen and by no less than Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio at that. Filmed with a clarity and scope not frequently seen in movies nowadays, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is an epic fitting the tragic story of the Osage nation and their quest for justice. In 1920s Oklahoma the Osage discovered oil on their land and benefitted tremendously from it. Flushed with wealth like never before they lived the high life - living in grand style, sending their children to the best schools in Europe, etc.. Unfortunately for them they were minorities in a racially complicated land that America is and soon they were in the sights of greedy and sinister forces that were hell bent on grabbing their gains in whatever way possible.The movie highlights the dark series of events that occurred focusing on an Indian family whose affluence turned out to be a curse as fate snatched one family member after another. Martin Scorsese shows late in his career his directorial flair as he compells solid and consistent performances from the stellar cast: an aging and bloated Leonardo DiCaprio; stately, hefty and attractive Lily Gladstone and patriarch from hell Robert De Niro. John Lithgow and Brendan Fraser deliver ace portrayals at the end of the film and the rest of the cast blend well into one viewable whole. The soundtrack done by the late Robbie Robertson enhances the scenes it graces on particularly the vintage Blues of the period. The film's length and languid pace give the story room to breathe in reaching its conclusion but I think the movie would have benefitted more from a shorter and punchier time frame considering the nature of the flick.One of the finest epics and one of the most notable cinematic releases of recent times, ""Killlers of the Flower Moon"" is a must see for fans of film, history, American Indians and race relations particularly in the United States. Bring out the soda and snacks, this is one you wouldn't wanna miss.",positive
234,"At 80 years of age, I'm sure I'm not alone in being thankful that legendary director Martin Scorsese is still defining age and not only making feature films but making feature films still right up there as some of the best on offer, as his mostly impeccable post 2000's filmography continues to enhance his reputation as one of the all-time greats.His first film since his somewhat divisive Netflix mob epic The Irishman from 2019, Scorsese has once again returned to numb-bum territory with his 206 minute adaptation of author David Grann's novel Killers of the Flower Moon, an adaptation that sees the bespectacled master collaborating with his old faithful team of Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio to gift us a meticulously made drama that thanks to its distributor Apple has arrived at a time when many films of this calibre have jumped shipped to 2024 release dates.In the times since The Irishman's arrival in 2019, Scorsese has been making headlines talking about the effects of Marvel films on the artistry of the film-making medium and more recently doubling down on his insistence that in an age where many individuals and family units spend most of their nights binging streaming services (and their phone screens), long running times for films aren't that big of a deal but despite all his passion and many valid points it's sad too say that Moon doesn't always earn its epic runtime as Scorsese's film is one you can always appreciate on an artistic level but one that remains mostly emotionally cold and devoid of spark across its repetitive and sometimes unfocused journey.Differing from Grann's book in a sense that for the majority of its proceedings examining the terrible murders afflicting the Osage Nation in Oklahoma in the early 1920's it points the lens squarely on the relationship and dealings of Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone's couple Ernest and Mollie Burkhart and Ernest's uncle William Hale (played with some grizzled glee by De Niro) rather than on the FBI's eventual involvement in what was happening in the state, with Jesse Plemon's Tom White and co only coming on board in the films later stages, Moon takes a respectful approach to the true life tale at the heart of its narrative but in doing so Scorsese forgot to make his film justify its runtime or give us an emotional core that would've been the magic ingredient this labour of love craves.Strangely much has been made about the film belonging to Gladstone's Mollie and how she is the true star of the show here but the actress who has previously been best known for independent films such as Certain Woman and First Cow doesn't really ever get too do to much here other than look sweaty and remain po-faced throughout as DiCaprio chews the scenery (and his lips) and becomes the real focus of Scorsese's gaze as the hard to read and often dimwitted Ernest, who battles insulin injections as some of the films most frequent attention grabbers.It's a typically solid performance from DiCaprio and witnessing him play off the likes of De Niro and in small moments Plemons and even a Brandan Fraser cameo is solidly entertaining but for such a dialogue heavy film there's nothing spectacular about the ensemble in Scorsese's film or in the beating heart stakes, with the relationship between Mollie and Ernest never one that takes hold the way in which one might've hoped for.With all this to consider the true star of Scorsese's at times dragging affair is the production values and stunning work of his creative team that includes memorable work by his DOP Rodrigo Prieto, with Moon one of the best looking and alive feeling films of the year, helping it overcome a sometimes intrusive and distracting score by the late Robbie Robertson and a poorly structured sound design that at times does a disservice to a film that wants its words to do much of the work.There's undeniable moments of magic in Moon (a fire on a farmstead or an opening segment at a train station come to mind) and when Scorsese finds his groove he's almost unmatched by any current or past director but for all the moments in his latest offering there's too many misses and mismanaged components for this to be regarded as one of his best works.Final Say -A film that tries desperately to be special and sometimes reaches that tagline, Killers of the Flower Moon is far from a misfire but there's an emotional coldness to Scorsese's pretty but overlong and repetitive epic that misses its chance to gift us the quintessential telling of a true life tale that should've made for a far more gripping and impactful feature, the type of feature that it clearly was aiming to be.3 1/2 paddlings out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",positive
235,"The storyline is interesting and thought provoking and a little guilt trippy. But the directing and movie making shows why you can always count on Martin Scorsese to make an incredible movie. Not one of his movies has been a flop. Not one has been of low quality because of the actors cast or the script used. Not one has been difficult to follow. Not one has been unexceptional.To include his movie Silence, which was a movie he made for himself and made it so late that it didn't qualify for the worthless Academy Awards (but that is another rant). He doesn't even seem to care about the marketability. He is in it for the ART. He is the Michaelangelo of movie making.I have never seen a Scorsese movie that didn't affect me. I watched Gangs of New York, walked out of the theater and had to stop and lean against a wall to sob uncontrollably. I was OK until I walked out of the theater.This latest Scorsese movie proves him the Master, all other directors can take a back seat to him, and I sincerely mean all.",positive
236,"For over 3hrs 26min you would be watching a good movie played by two legends: Leo and De Nero. However, the dialogues and chitchats are too long and could have been shorter. If you have time watch it, but, in my opinion, don't make time for it. I almost slept during the movie. The movie is showing some historical facts and you would appreciate the make of it. But I was expecting more from Scorsese as it could have been made differently using more unexpected events. It was somehow predicted throughout the movie. It was rated 15+ which made sense to me. It could have been nearly a 2hr movie and still sends the message.",positive
237,"Watching the killers of the flower moon, made me realise that nothing has changed, even today we see the same thing, in this movie we see white men marrying niaeve native Indian women so that they can slowly kill them and their families so that they can own the oil rich fields they own, today similar thing is happening Isreal, where local palestians are being killed and hounded out so that there wealth so that Isreal and it's settlers can have somewhere to live.The movie is good, although slow, however somehow it keeps you engaged, I didn't know much about this piece of American history, not surprised tbh, greed is an interesting thing, a human driven by greed will do the most inhumane things.Leo, Robert and lily are the heart and soul of the movie, Lily is excellent is her role, gentle yet strong, Leo plays the fool who loves money, which is uncle understood and used to manipulate him. Robert De Nitro is the star, he plays the hidden snake with perfection, he is your friend and but it's time to bite he takes the head, reminded me of today's politicians.Worth a watch.",positive
238,"Was so hyped for Martin Scorseses latest starring both his favourite collaborators Robert De Niro and Leonardo Dicaprio. But now i've sat through it i'm not 100 percent sure how i feel about it.At 3 and a half hours long i can't say i was bored by the movie. There was plenty going on, and the performances were as great as you would expect (especially Dicaprio) but there was just something stopping it from being amazing. I think knowing it was so long ahead of time could have killed it a bit for me. And i felt like i was waiting for it to go up a gear the whole time. But it never really did.It lacks the shock value or humour that alot of other Scorsese movies have, and has the same dour tone throughout its whole runtime. Which even people who love the movie. Will have to admit is long.The last hour or is still the best though and actually feels like the conflicts then should have used up more of that running time. I especially liked how they told us what happens after the movie at the end. Which was different.",positive
239,"I was so looking forward to watching a masterpiece after reading all the rave reviews. After seeing the movie I will never trust reviews again...ever. The story is an incredibly interesting historical occurrence, unfortunately it was not portrayed as so. I was thinking I was going to be crying or feeling heavy hearted after the movie was over, I felt nothing. I was incredibly interested in the Osage community, I learned nothing about them. I absolutely hated the fact that Leo was the main character, it wasn't the correct character placement. I felt nothing for him, didn't love him and didn't hate him. Same goes for Deniro. It was almost 4 hours of the same characters on repeat. No excitement, no climax, no story. I'm so angry and that's why I am writing this review at 1:30 in the morning, I just left after a 9:00 showtime! Not cool! The problem is, movies just aren't good anymore, there's no depth and no story line, it's all about the visuals. Just shallow stories that look pretty and unfortunately that exemplifies society today.",positive
240,"For me the movie is a masterpiece. It perfectly depicts human psychology, showing the extent to which a person can go for money or to escape, being capable of absolutely anything. It portrays how deceiving and killing someone next to you can be so commonplace, especially if they are Native American. The script is perfectly written, and the actors skillfully bring out every emotion. Leonardo DiCaprio is out of this world. Three hours pass so pleasantly, so I rate this as a 10. PS: The film is not recommended for fans of Mission Impossible and Fast and Furious, as it offers a different cinematic experience.",positive
241,In order to know the whole story and characters it HAD TO BE LONG. De Niro & DiCaprio were their usual awesome performance selves. I especially enjoyed Lily Gladstone. To hear what has been done to the Osage people's is deeply disturbing. The injustices put upon the Indigenous peoples of the US & Canada is heartbreaking. I am a child of the 60's and Ive lived through some of these terrible times. Most if not ALL of my Indigenous friends of my childhood are gone. Drugs - murder - diseases ... its so sad no one ever came to their rescue. Martin Scorsese did an absolute thorough and excellent job. I understand his passion for such a film to be made. Thank You Mr. Scorsese for your work and the much needed TRUTH.,positive
242,"Three and a half hours without a functioning inner tension arc didn't fulfill my high expectations watching Scorsese's latest opus magnum today. Once again Scorsese gives us a variation of his conviction that the so-called American Dream is nothing less than an inhuman nightmare.I liked the perfection in set design, costumes and camera work, but all in all it was a letdown for me. I kept asking myself if Scorsese's efforts in retelling the Osage County murders could do justice to the real events which historically happened there in the 20s of the last century.I should have left the theatre outraged and upset. Instead I felt disappointed and even a bit bored, because I didn't feel emotionally involved enough.The actors saved it for me, especially Lily Gladstone's Mollie. A face shining with dignity and unbreakable humanity, the only unforgettable impression I took out of this movie.",positive
243,"Scorsese, with the right choice, instead of narrating from the point of view of the FBI agents who solve the murder mysteries, tells the story from the heart of the story by Ernest and Molly, beautifully narrating this entire historical tragedy. The movie doesn't even have a second extra scene and even though the duration of the movie is three and a half hours, it never falls off the rhythm and keeps the audience on their feet until the last moment. Scorsese proves that even at the age of eighty-one, he still has the ability to create a masterpiece that will last. Killer of the flower moon is the best movie of this year.",positive
244,"Definitely nowhere near Scorsese's best work. Not even as good as gangs of New York. That movie flowed where this movie stagnated. Gangs of NY run time felt long and this one was 45 min longer. Unfortunately it changes the feeling from enjoying the movie to wondering is this almost over yet.. and then no it's not, another repetitive scene.I'm rating it 7 though so the movie is good it's just not that great. Had he cut some of the repetitive scenes and shortened it and made it flow better he could've made this a 10. Lilly was good, Leo was good, deniro was good. The story just didn't develop the characters well enough or give you any reason to be invested.",positive
245,"Killers of the Flower Moon is true crime from an idiot's perspective in conventional cinema at its peak. It is also way too long but we should've seen that coming.Scorsese teaches us multiple lessons for nuanced filmmaking: how to have respect for people and subject material, but also how to elevate tension and handle violence without glorifying it. The result is honest and realistic, whilst subtly guiding our emotions through a maze of plot and character.The screenplay is extensive in both its length and depth. It's quite quotable and explains the plot efficiently without sinking into blandness. Its characters are complex and are brought to life by a wildly well-suited cast. There are beautiful images. There is a subdued, yet fitting, score. Additionally, Killers of the Flower Moon has the best wrap-up scene of a legal drama I have seen in years.There is no more to say than: it's great. Can you find the wolves in this picture?",positive
246,"I love great character development, and for that reason movies end up being long. I understand dialogue gets drawn out for dramatic effect. But this film is excessive on both counts. Story and acting were solid. But the thought in my head after hour 2 1/2 was ""wrap it up."" I am a movie LOVER, so it's rare for me to have this thought. I was a little confused by Dicaprio s character. Was he mentally challenged? And Deniro played what he always plays, the gangster. I kept thinking a twist in the plot was coming, but being a true story they couldn't do that. Despite those things, it was a good film, not great (which it could have been) And it was a testament to the fact that the human heart is truly evil and desires the superficial things of this world. Horrific what happened to the families that got in the way of this greed.",positive
247,"I write as someone who didn't know much about this part of American history. What's very interesting is that this tragedy happened in Oklahoma when the Tulsa Race Massacre occurred 3 days after. A time when both Native Americans and Black Americans were killed because of their wealth obtained from oil ventures. This in itself kept me engaged in watching this long movie. When you are intrigued by past history which rips the heart, the length of the movie doesn't bother you. I agree with those reviews that it was a Scorsese masterpiece. I think those who like his creative style will enjoy this movie. Plus, the actors are incredible. This is definitely a movie for those who enjoy thought provoking history and movies that are brilliantly filmed.",positive
248,"I know it's Martin S. That made this film, but if it was anyone else they'd have gotten a 3 or lower. The acting was good, but somehow over a 3.5 hour long movie, I was not invested in a single character. There was no depth to them. There was a lot of fluff, not a lot of explaination of how people got to where they are. The previews were horribly misleading, if going expect a slow moving dark film that doesn't have many jokes, fun funny, or even happy moments. How Leonardo and his characters love interest got into a relationship is worse done than Anakin and Padme in the Clone Wars. At least and hour and a half could have been cut from that film.",positive
249,"""The Flower Moon Killer"" may not be Scorsese's best film, but it is certainly one of the best of the year. The director manages to reinvent his directing and scriptwriting methodologies at the age of 80, proving once again his talent in this three-and-a-half-hour film that passes quickly. This is the result of consistently engaging editing and pacing. Even though the villains are introduced early on, the suspenseful atmosphere permeates the entire work, featuring a magnificent soundtrack. The blend of western and noir dictates the pace of the scenes, and the photography is engaging, with beautiful symbolic and metaphysical framing and liberties.However, the performances don't grab as much attention, despite a star-studded cast including De Niro, who delivers a stellar performance as one of the greatest villains in recent years - this is not a spoiler. The standout is the unknown Lily Gladstone, who gives an outstanding physical performance. Scorsese may not extract everything from his actors in this film, and despite the excellent production design, the film's editing bothers me at times. It seems that even with the three and a half hours, many scenes were left out of the final cut. It's important to emphasize that this pertains to the editing, as the overall assembly is excellent.""While The Flower Moon Killer"" may not rank among Scorsese's top films, it is more than enough to be considered one of the best of the year and potentially sweep the Oscars.Rating: 8.5/10.",positive
250,"My overall feeling about this film is that if the filmmakers would have spent just a bit more time refining it then we could have had a masterpiece on our hands.The set design was maybe the best I've ever seen, the acting was understated but very good, the cinematography was fantastic, and I enjoyed the unique methods of storytelling littered throughout the film.However, I thought that the editing needed to tighten up (it took a while for the film to build up) and the dialogue writing was mediocre (it reads very matter-of-fact, almost like a Hemingway novel).Overall, I thought it was a well-made movie that is definitely worth a watch. It is very nice to see a film that is practically shot in a partnership with the actual group of people affected by the story. But, with a bit of refinement in script-writing and editing (maybe the edition of better sound mixing and score) we could have had a masterpiece on our hands.",positive
251,"Very interesting story, great attention to detail regards the period, good acting and fantastic cinematography. Having white people running around after oil rich native American Indians was the basis for a great epic. I am not sure how accurate to the history or the book the movie was, but it could have had shades of Kane and Abel.The reason I gave it a score of 6 is probably like most people who gave Killers of the Flower Moon a mediocre score, was the duration of 3.5 hours. The story could have been told much better in 1.5 to 2 hours. Many scenes were quite drab and bleak, which were appropriate but were very tiring when you had so much of them. There was one incredible scene of a fire at a ranch with the abstract figures of men trying to put out the flames.Another interesting decision by the director Martin Scoresse was to not have subtitles during certain dialogue's when people were speaking in the Osage Indian language. This was fine as it was only a few minutes every now and then but when you add up all of them over 3.5 hours, it was a lot of storyline that nobody could understand.Time and time again great movies are lessened by the Directors self indulgence. I can't think of any movie ever that deserved to go over two hours, never mind three and a half.",positive
252,"Given the talent of Martin Scorsese as a director, along with the exceptional source material provided by David Grann's book, the movie adaptation of ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" Has the potential to be a cinematic masterpiece. With Scorsese's keen eye for detail, historical context, and his ability to bring complex narratives to life on the big screen.Additionally, the cast, which included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, among others, provided exceptional performances that would further elevate the movie. DiCaprio, known for his immersive acting style, was particularly well-suited for the role, and his collaboration with Scorsese has historically led to critically acclaimed films.The length of the movie is something i hear a lot of people criticising, but i dont think anyone else could pull this off in this length.",positive
253,"I just returned home after watching Killers of the Flower Moon. My overall feeling: meh.1. This film was not the masterpiece that I was anticipating. I hoped the story would be gripping and evoke a lot of emotion in me, but instead I felt unmoved by this tragic true story.2. I suspect the book might be better than the movie.3. Solid performances from the entire cast. There were a few scenes where I caught myself in awe of the DiCaprio/ DeNiro exchange.4. This definitely should have been a 2-hr movie. It was WAY too long, containing a lot of drawn-out artistic scenes.5. I would grade this film as a ""B"". Glad I saw it, but I would not watch it again.",positive
254,"Set in one of the most darkest and forgotten tragedies in American history, Scorsese takes us on an emotional journey of the Osage Indian murders in the 1920's. Arguably, yes its very long, maybe too long, but not a minute is wasted with every scene adding to the authenticity of the present emotions.Where this movie really hits you is the incredible acting of the three stars. Leonardo Dicaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone are massively on top of their game. The screenplay that Scorsese and Eric Roth has produced is nothing short of perfection, really giving characters depth and empathy for the good and even the bad.Certainly post pandemic this is one of the finest films made in sometime. Come award season it's going to take some mighty beating for this film not to shine.",positive
255,"This Scorsese "" epic"" is mostly devoid of intensity and emotion. Surely the killings is perhaps the main part of this story- this was done poorly with zero sense of fear or dismay. This is surprising as Scorsese knows how to do a kill. Perhaps that was the point- to show it subtley like it was happening without anyone caring. I'm not convinced. I think this had to be handled better. I normally don't complain about long films but this felt long - mainly because I was bored. Too many sections laboured on. Also the investigation headed by Jesse Plemmons was not explained well ( how they were caught ) This was done much better in the superior Mississippi Burning 1988. The acting is good ( as you would expect) and some scenes and dialogue are worthy. Overall a disappointment.",positive
256,"Before seeing this movie, I thought I'd be good to check the non-spoiler reviews. Almost everyone was complaining meaningfully about the movie's length. And it was off-putting, I went to the theater yersterday with reservations. However...So, let's get to the point - is this movie too long? I personally believe it might be by around some 15 mins, but it did not bother me. You see, it's funny how people are saying they don't need constant action on screen to keep focus, etc., but when you get such an important subject, slow burn thriller and lots of dialogue, it's a problem all of a sudden. It's hypocrisy. If such an important subject was boring for y'all, sorry to say but you gotta work on your concentration issues. You can binge watch a series in a day but can't sit through a borderline masterpiece? Maybe we don't deserve anything good and Marvel stuff should just take over.Film is realistically 8.5/10, but due to absurd grades calling out the movie's length, I gave it a 10.Seriously people, stop moaning about the length. It's you. You're the entitled one. Being unable to sit through a great movie that lasts 3 and 26mins AND then complain later is more of a showint of your character. Weak. Be better.",positive
257,"Scorsese just cannot overcome his roots in double-crossing gangster movies and here he delivers one more instead of a movie dealing with the historical situation and context of Indian Osage.Too many elements of this overly long movie come directly from The Irishmen, Gangs of New York, Good Fellas, The Departed, etc. So much so that the significance of the Osage historical context is mainly buried and surfaces ornamentally only in the guise of the superficiality of Indian costumes and Indian looking characters.After 3.5 hours, little is known of the Osage Indians, nor all of the many characters, as they only come on as stereotyped villains, buffoons, grubby hands, depressed victims, good lawmen, bad lawmen, etc. It is a movie filled with carefully thought out camera shots, gunshots, scenic scenes, characters talking vacuously in their stereotypical character patois and mannerisms - most of the white men of the gangsterish flavour, most of the Indians of typical Indian flavour and no one seems to have a real solid human identity that one can get immersed with.I feel like I've just watched another long winded unoriginal gangster movie which merely BTW has Osage historical context as a backdrop.Just doesn't cut it to be a movie of any significance despite its purported historical importance and good cinematography ... it will probably be remembered more for its unnecessary length rather than anything else.",positive
258,"Don't get fooled by the director or the cast. Don't get fooled by the score either. It's 8.1 at the time of writing this but I assure you it will get down to no more than 7.5. This is a bad movie, plain and simple.The whole story is told in such a lackluster way that there is no drama to it. It's like reading a long (a very long) newspaper article from start to finish where everything is narrated in a factual and boring way. There is no stakes, no big question, no expectation and no rush. The characters are shrouded in no clouds of mystery and no one changes from start to finish.Went to watch it to in the cinema. Truly disappointing. I wasted my time, don't waste yours.",positive
259,"Another Masterpiece from the masterclass Film Maker Martin Scorsese. This is a Classic example of why Martin Scorsese is called the greatest filmmaker of the century.The Movie is about how and why Osage Nation (one of the Native American Tribe) people during 1920s suffered manipulation, fraud and numerous murders by outsiders eager to take over their wealth.There is not a single wasted minute. Each and every frame has purpose. A powerful and Dark Epic of love, Deception, Greed and Murder.Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio performance are unquestionable. They are indeed one of the greatest actors of the generation. Lily Gladstone performance was Phenomenal. She was terrific in her role. The rest of the Cast is humongous, and they were fantastic.Screenplay by both Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese was dazzling with Blazing pace. 3.5 Hours movie run time felt like 2.5 Hours. Editing by Thelma Schoonmaker was as usual Brilliant. Her editing style is a Master class on its own.This is the 10th Collaboration of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro with 50 years of filmography with each other.Music by Robbie Robertson was Fantastic.

260,"Sometimes a master director, due to his previous filmmaking legacy, achieves an iconic status. By doing so he becomes such a powerful directorial voice, that any project they are interested in making, gets an immediate resounding attention from producers and audiences alike.Martin Scorsese is with a doubt one of the greatest directors in cinema history and it seems his latest masterpiece 'Killers of the Flower Moon' might be what 'Schindler's List' was for Steven Spielberg a form of deep internal healing, through diving in to very sensitive subject, which needs to be treated with upmost respect.It also happens due to Marty's status as a director that he can bend a rules a little of standards set forth by film industry and set a lengthy running time of 3h and 26 minutes.On a budget of $200 million the highest budget for biopic in history, this slow paced drama, might appeal to movie goers, which want to experience extremely well crafted filmmaking experience.Apparently in the early script draft Leonardo DiCaprio was originally supposed to play a different role, of an FBI agent investigating murders of native Indians, which had more crime thriller undertone to this project, making it have more commercialized appeal.Thankfully due to change of the interest in playing much more challenging character, with its moral ambiguity, he might have secured for himself an Oscar nomination, to say the least. You can see that he listens as a character letting the information effect him and not only waits for his turn to say his lines.In his portrayal of Ernest Burkhart DiCaprio gave up on his vanity, which Academy of Motion Pictures really likes and wears this front teeth dentals, which misshapes his mouth in to an unpleasant grim simular to Robert De Niro's character William Hale 32 degree Mason, which on one hand seems to be a moral backbone of his community, on the other might be the manipulative antagonist, which everyone should fear, as he creates '""Order out of Chaos"",...;) Although less flashy DeNiro's performance is one of the best in years.The premise of the film is simple:""When oil is discovered in 1920s Oklahoma under Osage Nation land, the Osage people are murdered one by one - until the FBI steps in to unravel the mystery. ""As it is with period films attention to detail in terms of costume and production design is a must and I suspect nominations for Oscars will be given in both categories in March next year.Cinematography although lacking the usual 'bells and whistle's', so to speak is still beautiful in terms of composition and color correction making this film fit the period of 1920's to perfection. The dolly moves are less dynamic here then let's say in 'The Departed', but stylistically we still get the typical Scorsese signature camera moves, like the steady cam movements around the house, which introduces the environment ending on a actress, which plays the mother of the lead character. I did loved some off focus shots of fire, which esthetically look absolutely stunning. But considering the subject the picture coverage feels more reserved.You can see that Scorsese displays implacable respect for the subject letting the drama of the plot unfold, without over sensationalizing events, which less tasteful director might have gone towards a crime elements, turning towards thriller vs drama.As a minor criticism what can be mentioned is the fact that the running time of close to 3.5 hours the editor could have been more assertive in cutting some scenes down, considering that this film lacks a solid score and sound design, which often helps to engage audience and helps with pacing. It's not that there is no score, it just that it is put in the background opting for realism over emotional symphonies.As it is most scenes are dialog based, in todays world the audiences are use to being emotionally led by music or sound design. Without it it is very difficult to maintain viewers attention. I suspect however that the choice of minimizing impact of auditory stimulation, was done on purpose to enhance the overall respect for the subject, as well as believability to the period and sense of realism Scorsese wanted to achieve. Never the less better sound mix could have helped maintain audiences attention even better.As I decided to leave the best for last the minimalistic performance of Lily Gladstone might earn her Oscar nomination if not the Oscar itself.This struggling actress , finally got an opportunity to showcase very emotional yet internally subdued performance, which becomes a moral compass of the story.As the cinema screening was totally sold out this film is destined for awards and hopefully reasonable box office success.Is it a little too long? Perhaps, but judging by expression of the audience as they were
leaving the screening room, we all knew we saw something very special.An ambitious artistic collaboration, which again adds to the iconic status of Martin Scorsese filmography as a one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.",positive
261,"The true story of the Osage County murders as told through the lense of just one family. Arriving back from the war, Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo di Caprio) meets his greedy racist Uncle (Robert De Niro) who explains that all the oil on the land and hence the money is owned by Native Americans. His mission is to get white family members to marry into the oil rich families, kill the wives and inherit the family money. As a result, he agrees when Ernest falls in love with wealthy Mollie (Lily Gladstone) that he should marry her.Obviously with Scorsese at the helm directing a heartfelt expose of a truly dark page in US history, this was always going to be a good film, and of course it is. You do become completely absorbed in the story and watch in disbelief as the injustice and cruelty escalates. It is though at three and a half hours a considerable slog featuring eminently beautiful, compelling and soon forgotten scenes that merely labour the point no matter how well constructed. I can't help feel that few directors could have got away with a $200m budget for a 206 minute film.On the performance front, Di Caprio is excellent in an often bewildering, ambiguous role, De Niro, and possibly a touch overrated, is fine as the baddie, but it is Gladstone who really impresses, although the film, despite its length, doesn't seem to really give her room to grow.Overall then a compelling experience well made, telling an important story which you should catch - I did not though emerge in a state of grace from it partly because it rarely really got to me and once again it is far too long. I suggest if he wants to do this sort of thing again Scorsese should make a tv series like everyone else.",positive
262,"#KillersOfTheFlowerMoon is difficult to watch. It takes time to sink in that the cunning oppression of the indigenous people by the migrant and expansionist Whites has not passed even a hundred years. Though the story is told from the perspective of a White man of Italian origin, Maestro Scorsese, and the two main characters are of Italian origin as well (often giving the film a Godfather-esque flavour), abundant presence of indigenous actors and a leading lady locates the time and space of the narrative well. The three hour long film has quite a few 10-15 minutes long scenes with dialogues between two characters, but the charm of the actors and zero fluff writing makes it engrossing. The intensity of De Niro is such that one almost wishes for emancipation of the sinister character he plays. Di Caprio matches him scene for scene, and by virtue of the script, comes out a winner in the final scene. Lily Gladstone is a revelation and her nuanced act will be a top contender for the next Oscar. The background score by Robbie keeps the audience on the tenterhooks and rides the mood of the film for all the length.All in all, it's more than a film. It's a Masterclass in historical commentary and film making. And like all long classes, get a little saggy at places, but picks up well and leaves a long lasting impact.The sad part was the empty theatre. With the spectacle of Marvels or Mission Impossibles ruling the roost, a well told story from a master director too can't bring the people to the theatre. Tells a lot of the Insta reel groomed spectators of the current times.",positive
263,"Without doubt an important story to tell, and perhaps none other than Scorcese could have done it justice.Still, I feel the movie itself has many flaws. Even at 3 and a half hours runtime, I feel there are a few key missing scenes. And I'm not talking about instances of ""show, don't tell"", because I feel there are things that aren't even shown. For example, there are some relationships that are more important than what the movie lets you know, but then suddenly that relationship turns the entire movie around without notice. And vice versa, there are many scenes that should have been cut, as they have no significant impact to the story. It feels as if this is a story that someone is telling on a witness stand, and Scorcese decides to leave nothing out of it and also to not have any other accounts to fill in the blanks. The ending seems rushed too.All in all this is a powerful story that will stick with you for a long time. It truly shows the horrors of history and the power of greed. Even more importantly, it shows us how religion makes no difference in the morality of men. It is other, more powerful, forces that drives them, for good or bad.",positive
264,"Technically, the film is an exceptional masterpiece. No one can deny that. Scorsese is still so sharp which is unbelievable. The film is as good as it could be. There is no way to make the movie better and still stick to the gruesome and true story. The actors bring the movie to life, but does DiCaprio lack range?The movie is very true to the book it is based on. The research behind the book is absolutely incredible. No wonder the rights were expensive. But the fact that the film is so similar to the book is also the only problem I have with the film. The film flows like a non-fiction book and it becomes a little more like a history lesson than a feature film. This is more of a character and story study than most modern films which are usually plot driven. That everything works depends a lot on the fantastic acting.Gladstone is a great new face who shows a lot of emotion without doing too much. What a performance from her. De Niro is extraordinary and I had a hard time taking my eyes off him. DiCaprio was good as usual but I wasn't completely convinced.Before the movie started, I had him as the winner of the Oscar statuette. Most actors can only dream of a role like Ernest Burkhart and dream even more to be directed by the master of cinema. DiCaprio sinks into the character and does it phenomenally, but sometimes there slips through a bit of his usual tendencies that make the portrayal similar to much of what he has played before. Does he have somewhat limited range? Every time I see him, it's always DiCaprio I see. He doesn't have the chameleon skills of Denzel, who really lives his characters.One of the best films of the year and definitely something to watch if you like Scorsese. The film reeks of his style and it's perfectly crafted and directed. Sometimes you could smile because it was so perfect. Everything he does is literally perfect. No other director makes more than one perfect movie. This film deserves its long running time and doesn't feel completely impossible to work your way through. A film that tells an important and tragic story. This is something you will want to revisit many more times in the future.",positive
265,"This movie did not need to be so long, I would have enjoyed it a lot more if you took away an hour and a half of content. Can we bring back movies that are less than 2 hours?That is my main criticism of the movie other than that it was pretty good. It did feel very linear in its story telling but I still manged to enjoy it.The acting was really good, probably the best part of this movie and the sound design was pretty good too I enjoyed the continuous drumming throughout. There is a lot of good elements to the movie it just needed to be way shorter to be a more enjoyable watching experience.",positive
266,"People expect grandeur, but I want honesty. However, in Killers of the Flower Moon, Scorsese delivered generosity - for better and for worse.It is indisputable that Martin Scorsese's great rival in the 2023-24 awards season will be physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. In the film that could win the director his second Oscar for best director, his biggest rival is his generosity, but let's not fool ourselves, Scorsese wins over his ""opponent"" here (while in the duel against Nolan's grandeur... Not yet there is nothing defined).The story presented throughout its 206 minutes of running time does not hide from its opening minutes that the fate of the Osage is destruction. Unlike the base book, the implosion of the indigenous people begins by being presented inconspicuously, gradually progressing to a long sequence of torture against the tribe, and then to a great conclusion of torture against the torturers. Scorsese is generous in explaining these long sequences in long acts, which makes the connection with the drama greater, at the same time as it makes it excruciating to see so much tragedy without mourning. Here the living cannot mourn their dead, because there is no time for that, the mourning denied to the characters is missing in the narrative of oppression.It's good to see that the director and co-writer is fully aware that this film doesn't belong to him, and he does a lot to apologize for it (with an exceptional metalinguistic sequence, by the way), but he doesn't do enough, since he is so generous with his apologies that he naturally takes the direction of the story for himself, and transforms a story about grief into a drama, as explained previously, but the same difference is that in the narrative that Scorsese constructed, the lack of this element It is for the benefit of other themes, which precisely enhance the film.It is these apparent mistakes that the director makes himself king (but not the King Hale) of his territory, this mistake of transforming a Lily Gladstone film into a DiCaprio and De Niro film is where he activates his most frantic and careful level of commitment to his work. He is honest with his generosity, and honest with his mistakes, never failing to deliver the awesomeness that his films always deliver. Here, with a tremendous period setting, with such incredible performances, an extraordinary sound work and original soundtrack and an adequate script in its interventions, a great film emerges. Killers of the Flower Moon deserves to go far, and it deserves to be watched. Not that Scorcese should deserve anything, but honestly, here he does.",positive
267,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" (2023) grapples with a crucial and dark chapter in American history, but its pacing issues are evident. The first act lingers on for too long, and the storytelling feels drawn out, preventing the narrative from truly gaining momentum. Unfortunately, the predictability of the plot and the absence of necessary tension hinder the impact of the film. With a 3.5-hour runtime, the screenplay struggles to provide enough substance to justify the investment. This ambitious project somehow falls short of achieving its potential to be something truly epic, despite the brilliant performances delivered by Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone.While ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" may not fully realize its potential, the film does have its merits. Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone deliver outstanding performances, injecting depth and emotion into their respective roles. Their on-screen chemistry brings a genuine authenticity to the characters, making them one of the film's saving graces. However, despite these standout performances, the movie ultimately struggles to transcend its shortcomings. It fails to maintain the necessary tension and falls short of being a cinematic masterpiece. As a result, it leaves one questioning whether it truly does justice to the significant subject matter it attempts to tackle.",positive
268,"I went to this movie with zero expectation, I just read a few reviews that felt the movie was too long and ,,could have been told in 2 hours"".I actually wasn't bored and I think the movie was done really good. This is a very serious topic and I think it covered it well. Acting is also great. I don't think the music was that good but it had some rhythm throught the whole movie that I enjoyed.This movie is not for everybody, don't pull up in the cinema and expect some mcu type of fun because you are not getting any, the movie is very long and also sad.I can absolutely recommend this movie.",positive
269,"It is no easy feat to make a film about an atrocious but relatively little-known period in American history, the Osage murders in the early-to-mid-1920s in Oklahoma. But as every film lover knows, Martin Scorsese doesn't do ""easy."" He does ""great."" Scorsese has made a period Western crime epic that is exceptionally moving and insightful. It's a film deeply important in raising awareness of the historical injustices that have affected Native Americans while simultaneously being deeply rooted in compelling and character-driven storytelling.Scorsese's film is an adaptation of David Grann's book (which is also excellent, and I highly recommend reading it) of the same name. The film is quite long at 206 minutes, but the runtime never feels tedious or unnecessary. Every frame is meticulously shot and edited, and the film manages to show such a deep respect for the humanity of Osage people despite the brutal inhumanity they faced. The performances in the film are exceptional, especially the three most prominent characters (DiCaprio, Gladstone, and De Niro.) DiCaprio and De Niro are incredibly convincing, but it is Lilly Gladstone who elevates the film to the next level. She gives an extraordinarily emotional and moving performance that is a true master class in character development. The film also uses stunning production design to depict 1920s Oklahoma, and the film's soundtrack and score complement the tone and mood incredibly well too. Scorsese builds tension and drama incredibly effectively, often using shots that are both quick and wide and with greatly impactful results. The film also has a powerful conclusion that will be remembered by audiences.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" can be a bit of a hard watch at times due to its subject matter, but it's even harder to forget or not be genuinely impacted by. Do not miss this exceptional film. 10/10.",positive
270,"After reading the book I looked forward to the movie. I'm from Oklahoma and have friends appearing in the movie. (They were great, btw!)The movie mostly stayed true to the book but added in a lot of unnecessary backstory that only slowed it down. The fire scene was completely a waste of time.I would have liked to see more of Molly's efforts as described in the book, she doesn't seem integral to the movie except as a potential victim.I was really surprised to see di Caprio as Burkhart. He did a fair job but to achieve the jutting jaw of the actual Burkhart had to maintain a grimace throughout the movie. That was so apparently fake.A sickly child certainly was possible but again simply wastes time. The overall story drags. Very little of it is the investigation. That was a thrilling read and could have been so in the movie.Kudos to the Osage Nation for surviving and sharing their culture and story. I am so sorry!All this said I'd see it again--because it is relevant to me. I give it a 6.5, the acting was fine. It's the editing that needs help.",positive
271,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" promises to be a compelling cinematic experience, as expected from a Martin Scorsese film. It explores the intriguing and tragic story of the Osage Indian tribe in Oklahoma, who became extraordinarily wealthy due to the oil reserves found under their lands in the 1920s. This newfound wealth, however, attracted greed and led to a horrifying series of murders, known as the Reign of Terror.The movie is exceptionally long, running for 3 hours and 30 minutes, but there's never a dull moment. The brilliance of the writing and screenplay ensures that the story remains engaging throughout.The film subtly yet effectively conveys the gruesome extent of the characters' greed. Their willingness to commit heinous acts for money is laid bare in innocent, casual discussions, revealing a disgusting and cruel agenda against the Osage people.Lily Gladstone's performance as Mollie Burkhart is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. She brings depth and layers to her character, painting a vivid image of a woman caught in the crossfire of avarice and violence. Her portrayal is nuanced and raw, a testament to her phenomenal acting prowess.Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his consistently exceptional performances, truly outdoes himself as Ernest Burkhart. His acting in this film is arguably his best since ""The Revenant"". As Ernest, he is both compelling and repelling, a character study in duality and moral bankruptcy.Robert De Niro is at his best as the intimidating William Hale. His charm is ever-present, but it's the fear he instills through his performance that truly stands out. He effortlessly projects power, making his character both intriguing and terrifying.Martin Scorsese, veteran filmmaker and master storyteller, weaves this tale with his trademark dynamism and boldness. His direction is both enraging and sobering, painting a picture that is deeply disturbing yet impossible to look away from.The strength of ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is not found in dramatic acts of violence or intense, graphic visuals, but rather in the deep, poignant moments of quiet and the captivating narrative. Scorsese's strength lies in his ability to command the audience's attention through dialogues and characterization, and this film is a shining example of that.Scorsese's portrayal of the pivotal events in the history of America is commendable. He captures the culture and traditions of the Osage family with unstinting accuracy, ensuring the story's importance is not lost.However, the movie introduces a plethora of characters, which may initially seem overwhelming. This is understandable given the richness and grandeur of the story. Despite its long runtime, for those who connect with the movie, it's an experience that is superbly crafted and thoroughly immersive.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is also a wonder of technical brilliance, with each element meticulously designed to construct a cinematic masterpiece. It resonates profoundly with engaged audiences, affirming that the film is indeed the product of a mater in filmmaking.THIS IS TRULY A CINEMA.",positive
272,"This epic film is watchable because it is very interesting. Unfortunately it is not that entertaining. I expected more from a Martin Scorsese film. The acting is superb ... Leonardo is wonderful (they all are) but Leonardo was on fire ... Branoesque.One feels the story of the Osage has been left untold for too long - 100 years. It is moving, unfair and horrid. Taking advantage of other's innocence and largesse is an uncomfortable human trait.The film is slow to start and really only ever picks up to a medium pace. It was pleasing to see the native Americans speaking like Americans and like some caricature.",positive
273,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful1920's, the south of America. The Osage Nation, a community of Native American residents, come into fortune when they strike oil on their patch of land, giving them ownership rights. Ernest Buckhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) arrives to stay with and work for his uncle, Bill Hale (Robert De Niro), a grandstanding figure in the community and reserve Deputy Sheriff, and soon finds himself embroiled in events over his head. As a series of Osage murders take place, with little investigation and no arrests, things take a turn when Ernest marries Osage girl Mollie (Lily Gladstone), and after her sister Anna (Cara Jade Myers) is killed, he is forced to search his soul to do the right thing.In the winter of his life and career, Martin Scorsese has his sights set on crafting his magnum opus, epic, ambitious tales large in scope and heavy in content, after 2019's similarly mammoth The Irishman, which you could watch at your leisure on Netflix, but now this three and a half hour effort has arrived in theatres, which however much of a Die Hard stalwart of the man you are, is something of a test to sit through. KOTFM sets itself off on unsteady footing, with an opening that doesn't really grab you in quite the dynamic way it could, and a lot of meaningless exposition that could reasonably be shed.That's not to say the story doesn't develop, and hold your attention just about all the way to the end. The film conveys a creeping, behind the scenes scandal unfolding, not the forefront placed, out in the open style Scorsese employs with his usual gangster films. It all just becomes a little overwhelming at times, however much depth it adds to the story. Performances wise, Scorsese has reunited with regular lead stars Di Caprio and De Niro, and they create a reliable, effective dynamic between each other, De Niro pulling off a fine Southern accent. In the third act, acting heavyweights Brendan Fraser and John Lithgow make a sudden appearance as rival lawyers, in a courtroom setting that is winkably reminiscent of the ending of GoodFellas.The final scene takes a surrealist turn, with a theatre production encroaching the events of the last several hours into a theatre production, with the director himself making an appearance, in a style reminiscent of a Spike Lee production. As it is, it's an overwhelming but still absorbing and powerful portrayal of a shameful chapter in American history. ****",positive
274,"I love Scorsese but I could not bare to endure the Irish man ( although I did end up finishing it over 2 days). That said, this movie does not drag quiet as much. It does have a great story line, great production and great acting, as many people say, but it does not have a comprehensible story arc. There is no plot, no protagonist, and the movie is an hour too long.I also feel like character development was missing because they were trying to deliver too much information.Did you really need to show us the court case and how that whole thing went down? The answer is no. You could've ended the movie at the time of the arrest, or before the court case.",positive
275,"Maybe I'm biased because I've lived on and off in Oklahoma my whole life. I really enjoyed seeing how the Native Americans and whites intermingled back then. Of course the whole story was utterly disgusting but it had a satisfying ending. I think DiCaprio did a great acting job. Loved the movie. I didn't even notice it was 3 hours long until I left and it was dark outside.I loved some of the characters so much. They were really interesting! Of course the subject matter was sad, but I'm so glad they made this movie illustrating what really happened.I really enjoyed the interactions between between.",positive
276,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a lenthgy dive into a incredibly engaging and horrifying true story. Scorsese plus let loose and the movie shows that freedom, in lenthg and some scenes. But what made Casino so special, what made Goodfellas so special, what made older movies of his special was the incredible editing and feeling of everything coming together, sadly that is missing here.Goodfellas is my all time favorite movie. So I just had to see this, in theaters. In a way it shares a lot of similarities to a typical mob movie Scorsese is experienced in. And it becomes more and more apparent. From the lowly simple ""kid"" from a war that comes back to a warming family that promises and promises, the ""don"" , uncle. It's all there pretty much. But I have to say again. The main failure of this movie to me was it's chaotic editing, it's lack of proper backstory on some characters, the pacing whilst it was steady, it never picked up enough to bump those final moments and exciting moments into a higher atmosphere. Afterwards and the way it starts and ends feel like this should've almost been a documentary. In a way it's a ""alternative"" I guess.Cinematography gets a shout out though, stunning looking movie.The acting is phenomenal, though not perfect from everyone. The ones that matter own it though. De Nero also seems to be into it. Nothing else to note.Music decent, though lots of use of silence throughout, again, coming back to that documentary aspect.I can definitely say it's a devisive movie. If you are into this story and know a little more behind it you'll love it and love the time it takes. But if you're here for a classic Scorsese movie, you'll be slightly let down. Man, I wish he cut this movie down at least 30 minutes to an hour, so much potential.",positive
277,"Lost for words to be honest.The story has a lot of potential, tho Scorsese doesn't get the message across.I get the feeling that this is a very American idea of self criticism, just without the actual criticism.You can't just throw some money around for big names in the industry and think this will guarantee succes.This movie is way, way, way, way, way...sorry, I dozed off again, too long to be in theaters. Maybe it was intended, but it feels more like a documentary than a movie.The long stretched shots are extremely boring and painful to watch.Me and my compagnon both fell asleep during this movie.There is little to nothing to stay interested.After what turned out to be 30 minutes of sleep, it turns out I could still pick up where I left. Didn't miss anything to understand the story or where it's headed.I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. Even the ending isn't interesting.At some point I stopped caring all together, because I just wanted to leave.Don't be fooled by reviews of people praising this movie, there is nothing artistic I've missed, nothing to discover, it's just plain boring and that's that.Could have read the entire book while watching excruciatingly slow paced movie instead.I can definitely appreciate movies with not a lot going on, no bombastic exaggerations and such, but there needs to be at least a tiny bit of entertainment. Or at the very very least, it needs to grab and hold your attention. It's simply didn't have any of that. That's why I think this should be seen as a documentary rather than a film.",positive
278,"It seems a running time over three hours automatically spawns a rash of criticism along the lines of it's overlong, boring, director can't edit his films - from the tik tok generation who have the attention span of a gnat. Well this film is weighty enough to justify its running time. The casualness and banality of the evil it shows is just on another level, and it's played out masterfully by De Niro, Dicaprio and Gladstone. It's a truly harrowing and difficult movie to sit through, poking you in the eye with uncomfortable truths at every turn, about human deceit, greed, corruption, racism, power. It is beautifully shot, the score is effective but never up front and centre, and the story holds your attention from beginning to end. Scorcese has aged like fine wine, I truly believe this is perhaps his greatest movie. I can't say I will watch it again because it's just too uncomfortable, but it's a tour de force, a masterclass in filmmaking, and I am happy to counter the tik tok generation who couldn't sit through a 3 minute trailer without glancing at their smartphones.",positive
279,"'Killers of the Flower Moon' and other of Martin Scorsese's latest creations remind me of Alfred Hitchcock's late career films. That last period lasted about 12 years for Hitchcock, during which he made 6 films. I hope that Scorsese will also be blessed with a long and productive life from here on out and that we will see more movies after 'Killers of the Flower Moon'. Both directors have already earned their place of honor in the Pantheon of the art of cinema. Scorsese now, like Hitchcock after 1964, has nothing left to prove and in his case - unlike Hitchcock - no statuette that he has not yet held in his hand to win. He can make whatever movies he wants and get any funding for his projects. What he chooses to do is his decision alone. The similarities do not end here. In 'Killers of the Flower Moon' we can see an episode of attempted murder by poisoning and even a scene with the glass into which poison is poured shot in full shot, a scene that seems to be a direct homage to Hitchcock. And yes, Scorsese also has a cameo appearance, as the master of suspense had in most of his films. What Scorsese chooses to do is to revisit some of his favorite themes from previous films - the gangster families with the rules and codes that kept them together, the connection between American history and organized crime and the history of the FBI. But all these serve a judicial idea - bringing to light a tragic episode of the fate of the Amero-Indian Osage tribe, which took place in the previous century, in the 20s. Scorsese does one more thing that was highly commented by the viewers who saw the film and the critics who wrote about it. He doesn't look at the clock. 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an epic that runs for almost three and a half hours, which is an hour longer than the recent - already long - standard for Hollywood films. For me these 210 minutes went by faster, more intensely and more rewardingly than 100 minutes in many other films, but from what I've read, many viewers had a different opinion, gave up watching before the end or if they resisted, they criticized.The story of 'Killers of the Flower Moon' has the premises of a classic western. Whites and the descendants of the native inhabitants of North America are fighting for a piece of land full of resources. The fight is bloody and unequal, every possible method is used and the end is known from the history books. In this case it is about a true episode described in David Grann's documentary book that inspired the film script. In the second decade of the last century, huge oil deposits were discovered in Oklahoma. Some of the unfriendly lands beneath the oil, however, belonged to the Osage Indian tribe, who had been relocated here some time ago from their ancestral lands. The Osage Indians in that area became overnight the US inhabitants with the highest per capita income. The desire to get rich quick in this oil-based El Dorado attracted tradesmen, adventurers and criminals, some of them returning from the fronts of the WWI. Among them was Ernest Burkhart, who settled with his brother or on the farm of their uncle, William King Hale, the owner of a huge ranch. The two brothers became participants in a complex plan to dispossess the Indians through various methods, from marriages with tribal women and banking control of the Indians' wealth to assassinations, also including alcohol intoxication and food poisoning (the Indians were predisposed, genetically and due to differences in traditional diets to diabetes and other diseases) or plain poisoning. Ernest will marry Molly, a beautiful and intelligent Osage woman. Everything happens under the tutelage of 'King' Hale who acts as a patron and friend of the tribe (learns the language and customs, participates in their events) and in parallel plans and orders the execution of criminal plans. When private investigators and the federal government begin to take an interest in the series of mysterious deaths, the relations between the two conflicting societies and the marriage and love story between Ernest and Molly are put to the test. The investigation of these murders and the trial that followed were the subject of the first major public case of the newly formed FBI under J. Edgar Hoover (whom Leonardo DiCaprio had played in Clint Eastwood's 2011 'Edgar').To place the Oklahoma conflict in an American historical context, Martin Scorsese uses archival news clips. In a 'film within film' scene, some of the characters watch footage of the racial incidents and the Tulsa massacre in 1921. The clear intention is to show that discrimination against black and Indian populations, at that time and in American history in general, are similar phenomena, which must be equally considered. The film tries to be authentic and very respectful of the Osage culture. Some of the dialogues are conducted in this language, which had also been learned and used by whites in family relationships and everyday interaction during that period. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro shine as always under Scorsese's guidance and deliver two exceptional roles. The trio is completed by Lily Gladstone, as a Molly full of wisdom and dignity. The impossible love and hate story between Ernest and Molly works and moves mostly because of the actors. A few familiar faces such as Jesse Plemons, Scott Shepherd and John Lithgow also appear part of a large and excellently directed cast, where each small or supporting role seems to be a colorful and functional piece in a constantly moving ensemble. Editing plays an important role and the narrative has a good pace, how strange it seems to say such a thing for a 3 and a half hour film. The composition of the images is often memorable, both in the scenes where the mobile camera walks us in long shots through Hale's domain, and due to the lighting that dramatically highlights the characters, in the style of the Caravaggio paintings. 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a saga about the disappearance of a world destroyed by human greed with the complicity of the system. Even though justice was partially served by the legal system, history has been unkind to the Osage tribe. The criminals got out of prison and lived for many years afterwards. Ernest Bruckhart outlived Molly, who succumbed to diabetes at the age of 50, by almost half a century. The book and now Scorsese's film do a great job in making the historical record straight.",positive
280,"I am not religious, but the words 'utterly wicked' kept entering my head as I watched the cold, greedy and brutality reigned upon the Osage people.This film aims to capture, of course, a very important account of just a fragment of the devastating impact so many who settled in America had upon the first nations people. Scorcese has certainly not shied away from depicting the violence, but also the almost systematic, organised intentional killing by the 'white man'. It is heartbreaking and ignited such rage and disillusionment in me. I know humans can be very cruel and do awful things, but generally I'm someone who believes that most of us are good, but in extreme circumstances we can make very bad or even inexplicable choices.However, this is a bit like Schindlers list, or 12 years a slave, when my heart feels despairing. As is clear from my comments so far, the film was very successful in emotionally engaging me. The acting was mostly brilliant, and the set, cinematography etc were undoubtedly impressive (which, with such a huge budget & talented director/crew, I'd expected).I am glad it was made and definitely film/drama, as well as entertainment, should be used as the powerful instrument it is, to create empathy, educate, and encourage the audience to take a new perspective and challenge our world view/existing beliefs.But, as I think many have said, I definitely feel this was in need of editing down into a sharper film. Or, it would have worked better as a miniseries done slightly differently. I am guilty of not being concise, so I get the difficulty of trimming down what one creates, but I also think as such a seasoned film maker, Scorcese/his team made a weaker film because they couldn't or wouldn't make intelligent necessary cuts. I worry some will be turned off and turn off due to the length and how drawn out it is.Something else I felt uncomfortable with was the portrayal of Ernest. While he was certainly not shown to be a good man, there is a strong leaning, I felt, to cast him as more of a manipulated victim of his uncle (I'm sure many felt huge pressure to take actions that they knew were heinous), which attempts to dilute/explain his huge part in the mass murder of Osage People. Obviously it cannot be ignored that these things, and people are complex. Plus I know it would be cheap to make complete villains of all one group and victims of another.However, I worry that there was too much attention paid to his story, from HIS perspective, which took away somewhat from the atrocities he himself repeatedly committed. I will definitely do as I always do with films based on real events and people, and take a deep dive into the 'true story' that informed the script/account. I hope very much that others, even if they don't watch it, or especially if they want to pass on the movie, are encouraged to read or listen and pay energy and attention to this dark time. History truly was white washed. And is certainly HIS-story in the main, and i feel as much as scorcese may have intended to change this, Killers of Flower Moon still felt laden with these same old dominant influences.",positive
281,"Flowers of the Killer Moon cannot be described as enjoyable due to subject matter, but it holds you with the tension it creates from a continual sense of impending dread for large chunks of the running time. Being a story about selfish, greed-driven acts of violence perpetrated by the most two-faced individuals, it is pretty shocking from start to finish.It is of course a Hollywood movie based on fact, so (like so many others) in between the portrayal of documented events the screenwriters fill in the gaps with character drama and dialogue that frame the events for an engaging screen portrayal. We see intimate moments between certain characters that can only be the result of the writers speculating what might have been said or done in scenes that fit the story. Martin Scorsese depicts all these moments cinematically, so as long as long as you appreciate this fictional aspect of the portrayal and do your own research about the key events, (i.e. What is documented to be true and not documented) it can serve as an important and informative introduction to the Osage Indian murders.In terms of pure filmmaking, for me it is another classic from Scorsese. The cinematography, editing and production design combine to tell the story in an immersive way that recreates the time and place fantastically well. There are some typically Scorsese moments that make certain scenes very memorable like one-shot walkthroughs of a house interior with brilliantly choreographed physical acting. I love the scenes with fire and heatwaves, plus the general shot composition, use of colours and grading is fantastic.All actors are excellent particularly Lily Gladstone, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert DeNiro.There has been a lot of criticism aimed at the pacing and length of the film. Personally, I do not think it is too long. When a film production goes to such lengths to recreate a place and time to tell an important story, it feels justified to commit the time to view all the great work. Personally, I would have not included the paddle scene and the Coolidge scene as they are the more obvious and blatant moments of fiction that can be easily researched and without them the story would have lost none of its impact. Also, some of the dialogue is either too quiet or slightly mumbled during certain exchanges and I had to use subtitles.For me its a 9.5/10, but I round upwards.",positive
282,"Firstly it looks great, and the editing is as ever masterful, I always look for her name, I think it's Thelma Schoonmaker, I know she has edited for Scorsese for over 30 years and she's a genius, the production design is great, (a special mention for Leo's teeth!) the sense of era and cultural tone immersive, the story fascinating,... so what goes wrong, why do I start clock watching after an hour, knowing I've got another 135 minutes to sit through, well, I think it's a question of vanity, screenplay and perspective. Vanity on the part of the director and the two male leads, in particular di Caprio who is asked to, though I have the feeling he enjoyed it, mug for the camera in mid shot every different way conceivable, all amounting to being a slimy wretch, the screen play by Scorsese and Eli Roth, in so many ways is a conundrum, a piece of restraint, and detail, but without any character arc told essentially from the point of the bad guys and this is the major flaw, perspective! Because the bad guys are essentially bad throughout, nothing shifts essentially except the ever more gruesome depths to which they'll sink, in total denial of their immorality, they have no depth, they are evil at its most banal, in the same way as America itself was in this era of apartheid, so then it's just a gawkish bit of rubber necking at their hideous exploits, given the fact that it's so long, less screen time for De Niro and Di Caprio and more time for the frankly incredible ensemble would have elicited more sympathy and more emotional breadth, and impact, in essence it's an exploration of a tawdry evil, which we are confronted with relentlessly, and the pace drags interminably do that it commits that most heinous of cinematic sins, it becomes dull, and the constant playing of rootsy southern blues Americana to place it and emphasise the melancholy starts to grate whilst trying to act as filler, this could and should have been great and the story deserved it to be, the victims, not least Molly who is a superbly realised and acted heroine, but I have a feeling that ultimately the problem was that this was crying out to be a mini series, not a movie, and getting caught in between loses the best of both genres.",positive
283,"It's difficult to watch because it again highlights a gross injustice done to this tribe. Greed is a sin.These people who want to benefit from the good fortune of others stop at nothing to further their own desires for wealth. The wolf in sheeps clothing is on full display here. Pretending to be friends and really caring for the well being of the Osage people they manipulate family members and put in motion ways and means to the detriment of those they claim as friends. They are killing the Osage people with their ""kindness"" and concern for their well-being. They stop at nothing to get their way.",positive
284,"The first hour of this movie I loved and I was excited to see where the movie went. After finishing it, I felt like something was missing. I Googled the real story and I think this just needed some better writing so there would have been some better character development. The motives behind characters actions weren't always clear, which made the movie confusing at times. A younger actor for Leo's role would have also benefited this movie. It's still an important story to be told and a solid movie, it just had some room for improvement. I'd still tell my friends/family to give it a watch (I'd even rewatch it at some point), but I'd warn them it's not Scorscese's best work.",positive
285,"Waaay Too long. The radio show ending that wraps up the storyline, came across as surreal and out of place in a docu-drama; not to mention disappointing. But, the acting was great! I hated that greedy Mr Hale character just as much as I actually dislike Di Nero himself. It's kind of hard to recognize gifted acting when you actually dislike someone, but Di Nero was manipulatively ruthless did an excellent job. I felt Di Caprio, as always, did a great job with the material. LOVED Lily Gladstone! Now that lady should definitely win an Oscar for her performance. The movie had a decent script, as well as, sets and costumes too. It just was about an hour too long. Still worth seeing.",positive
286,"Director Martin Scorsese's much-anticipated film, ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" falls short of the high expectations set by his previous masterpieces. Despite the star-studded cast, breathtaking cinematography, and a compelling historical backdrop, the film ultimately disappoints, leaving me with a sense of dissatisfaction.The story delves into the conspiracy surrounding the murders, which involved the newly discovered oil wealth of the Osage Nation. The FBI, led by J. Edgar Hoover, investigates the crimes.Dicaprio plays the lead as Ernest Burkhart, following with Lily Gladstone playing Mollie Burkhart and Robert De Niro playing William Hale, the great cast goes on. In spite of this great cast, their performances disappoints. The characters lack the depth and development needed to evoke genuine empathy or interest. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, while undeniably skilled actors, seem constrained by the underdeveloped script, leaving their performances feeling somewhat flat, repetitive and unremarkable.Moreover, the film struggles with its tone, wavering between a historical drama and a crime thriller without fully committing to either genre. The result is a narrative that feels inconsistent and indecisive.While the cinematography is undeniably stunning, with sweeping shots of the Oklahoma landscape, it often feels like a distraction rather than an enhancement to the storytelling. The visual grandeur sometimes overshadows the narrative, leading to a lack of cohesion between the film's aesthetic and its substance.The biggest problem with the film is the lack of tension, De Niro is way too old for his part, his slow movement and powerless/repetitive acting ruins every opportunity to create tension between him and other characters. The characters are supposed to be ""scared"" of De Niro, but the film fails to show us that. Dicaprio is also too old for his character Ernest. William hale was in his 50s during the 1920's and Ernest I believe was in his late 20's.In conclusion, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a disappointment from a director of Scorsese's caliber. The film's inability to find a consistent pace, streamline its intricate narrative, and develop compelling characters ultimately hinders its potential. While the visuals may be captivating, they cannot compensate for the film's overall lack of coherence and emotional resonance. It doesn't deserve a runtime of 3 hours 26 min.Rating: 7/10.",positive
287,"Not sure why everyone likes this movie, thought it was horrible. One of the most dry, unimpressive diaolouge movies I have ever seen. The characters are cheesy at best. I know who the director is ajd I get the premice. The movie is just bad. Maybe 3 action shots and the rest talking. Not talking in an interesting way like 12 Angry Men. But talking in the most boring cheesy fashion ever. If you have 3 hrs to burn, go bowling. Hopefully the next one he directs will be about tornados or hurricans or maybe thw civil war. Waiting for Napoletian with Phoenix to come save me from the torture. Two thumbs down.",positive
288,"I understand a lot of reviewers complaining about how long this movie was. I also read a review stating that this movie gets repetitive in portraying the women of the Osage, who were killed for their money. I sort of get that, but then you have to be able to understand what Scorsese was trying to do. This is a drama based on real events, and these were real people, to whom unthinkable things were done, time and time again, with no consequences. It is harrowing to watch, if you give these people a second thought while watching this movie, and think what they went through. It may not be for everyone, but it is certainly not too long, especially when it is trying to give voice to people, who have long been gone, but their time was cut short by the white man's greed.",positive
289,"Eric's Grade: A-
'Killers of the Flower Moon' is the latest film from vaunted director Martin Scorsese. He serves not only as director, but is a co-writer and producer on the film as well. It features now standard acting collaborations for Scorsese with Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert DeNiro in primary roles. 'Killers' also features Native American actress Lily Gladstone who has been working in film and TV since 2012 but this film has really elevated her into the spotlight. Her performance of Mollie Burkhart has garnered critical acclaim including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. The film debuted at Cannes in May 2023 before receiving a theatrical release in October. 'Killers' is one of the best reviewed films of 2023, but despite receiving 10 Oscar nominations it failed to win a single one.As most people know 'Killers of the Flower Moon' surrounds the systematic murder of members of the Osage Nation in the 1910s & 1920s with the ultimate goal of attaining the oil headrights of the Natives. The white establishment shuffled the native Osage population onto what was thought to be undesirable land, however, in 1897 oil was discovered on the reservation making the Osage incredibly wealthy. Ernest Burkhart is played by DiCaprio and returns from WWI to work for his uncle William ""King"" Hale in Oklahoma. Hale is played here by Robert DeNiro. Hale first floats the idea of marrying an Osage to his nephew who seems amenable. Ernest is kind of doltish and essentially a yes man for his domineering uncle. Ernest meets and marries the Osage woman Mollie Kyle who's family possesses oil headrights. Over the course of their marriage they have three children together. At first it is uncertain how malevolent Ernest is, but as time goes by he sheds any innocence he may have possessed in the employ of his uncle who blatantly orders him to do away with many of Mollie's family members in order to consolidate the oil headrights. William Hale is used to getting his way to say the least. He is a corrupt political boss and while ostensibly presents himself as a friend to the Osage he secretly orchestrates political suppression and murder to keep the Natives under his thumb. What he doesn't account for is the growing reach of the federal government and the power of the newly imbued Bureau of Investigation which would morph into the FBI. Therefore when President Coolidge finally sends the Bureau to investigate it doesn't take long for the dominoes of Hale's destruction to start falling. They find Mollie near death who had slowly been being poisoned by her husband. While at first hesitant and wishy washy Ernest eventually testifies against his uncle, but too much has already occurred for Ernest to save himself or retain his marriage or family.Sitting down to watch 'Killers of the Flower Moon' carries some intimidation with it. This is not a comedy or an action extravaganza. You are sitting down to 3 Â½ hours of white people oppressing and murdering Native Americans. Despite the heavy subject matter and the gargantuan run time the film is paced quite well. This is another one of those stories that has been kind of lost to history, and even knowing depravity of white people regarding Natives before WWII it is still shocking to encounter such a blatant atrocity carried out only 100 years ago. Scorsese as always does a masterful job with his direction and visuals. The film is elegant and emotive, yet also has some brief staccato moments of violence that stun you as the viewer in their boldness. It is a fascinating story to watch play out over the run time of the film. I never want to step in a place where I victim shame, but one of the largest questions I walk away with is how did the Osage not realize what was going on, and take methods to insulate themselves? For as devious and underhanded as the plot eventually gets at first these Osage women had to accept white husbands in order for any of this to work. In one case after one guy's wife days he goes and marries the older sister! It seems like the tribal elders are aware, to some degree of what is going on, but they don't seem to be doing anything to actually stop it outside of petitioning the federal government which eventually comes through. The other interesting thing to watch is Ernest's character development as well as his relationship with Mollie. Not knowing the story I didn't know how involved he actually was in the whole plot. It is one thing to marry an Osage woman thinking you might get rich from it, but it is another to take an active role in not only the murder of her family members, but the poisoning of his wife. He seems to want both lives where he is living in his uncle's good graces, but also a good husband to his wife, and I think there is a moment she actually gives him a chance, despite all that has occurred, to come clean but he falters, and as a result loses his family and his freedom. 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a fascinating story based on real events that deserves to be watched, digested and understood from one of America's most masterful film makers shining a light on an ugly black eye in our history.",positive
290,"Well made. Interesting.But oh my god. Why so long? It was great for the first two hours. Then I gave up caring. I just wanted it to end one way or another. And realising there was still 90 minutes left to run, I couldn't help but wonder why someone would make a movie this long. It's just too much.It seemed to jump over detail at the start with the Osage earning wealth, and skipped straight to deaths. And then proceeded slowly. Skipped over how Leo's character developed a relationship with his wife to be.... Then covered aspects of planning of each death to the nth degree. So not only long, but the massive runtime used in odd ways.Flawed and not something I'd rush back to watch again.",positive
291,A twisted love story in the midst of a ruthless takeover. This is a story that pictures the dawn of a system that's fuelled with greed and bloodshed. Performances by the whole cast was amazingly sharp. Great visuals and cinematography that contrast the booming oil business to the harmony in the green seas of Indian lands. Great audio effects that plays a major role in the movie. There's documentaries that dives deeper into history but Killers of the Moon reanimate the history of the minority's struggle to survive in an invasion. Sincerity in performances were a true gift that no one should keep from unraveling.,positive
292,"I was expecting this to be better. I thought the film was poorly cast. At this point there are too many movies made with Leo and Deniro and it is hard to separate their real identities from the film characters. Molly's role was written in a way where I couldn't have much suspension of disbelief. How could a woman this smart not see through the devil's eyes? How could a skeptical woman believably marry this man whose close relative she deemed scary. Her character was far too stoic to really feel emotion besides feeling sorry for her and her gullible ways. Though I was happy with Scorsese actually creating a film about the Osage that didn't make all men heroes, I thought it lacked a certain feeling. I felt enraged and disgusted, uncomfortable. It definitely made an impact. I still think it was not executed well.",positive
293,"Many people didn't see or didn't like it specifically because of how long it is. That is completely understandable as a movie that is nearly 4 hours long is not something you can just sit down and watch. I didn't read the book, But I still found it very enjoyable. Like many I have only seen the movie once, but will not rewatching for quite a while because I have other things to do with my life. The acting was good, Lily Gladstone should have won the Oscar for best actress in my opinion. There was some things I was a little iffy on but they didn't change my opinion on the movie. I recommend this movie to people who have the time and energy to watch a story like this. 8/10.",positive
294,"This movie has a nice basic story, historically important. However, the story telling is tedious and the acting is mediocre.The length of the movie isn't justified by any mean. The rhythm of the movie is way too slow.Save the main three characters, the rest are superficial and do not help in creating a depth so necessary for carrying the audience along the storyline.The one bright aspect of the movie is the actress who plays Mollie, Lily Gladstone.Evidence for this review? Sure. While watching this film ten couples walked out mid screening. That was about a sixth of the audience.In summary, if you've got nothing else to do for 3 1/2 hours, by all means watch this movie. My advise? Don't.",positive
295,"This movie is a solid 8/10. Yes, it can be slow at times but it is beautifully done and full of history. It's a part of history that I had no clue about and should be taught. The Osage deserve at least that but really so so much more. I think if you haven't read the book you are at a disadvantage. It really helps knowing the history and story going into the movie otherwise you might feel a bit lost and be bored with the 3 1/2 hour time. I love the first 10 minutes, having just finished the book the beginning really brought to life what I just read and tried to imagine. The costumes and set really brings the whole story to life. The acting is wonderful and beautifully done. If you have read the book definitely give this a watch.",positive
296,"I found this film slow, tedious, and two-dimensional. It left out 90% of the factual history, including the breadth and scope of the Osage murders.It was very undramatic, and seemed very self-indulgent in favor of Scorsese's long-time pals, Leo DiCaprio and Robert de Niro -- to the tragic exclusion of the Osage side of the story, which was mostly ignored.It also insults the audience by including numerous long conversations in Osage, none of which were translated.All in all, a poor showing in my opinion. The one bright spot is the luminous Lily Gladstone, who is the only reason I might recommend watching this lengthy but bland film.I might have had a different opinion of the film if I had not read the book -- I can't tell. I read the book two or three years ago and I can assure you it is mesmerizing. I did not feel this film did it -- or the Osage murders -- justice.",positive
297,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",positive
298,"Everything is coming down to that one cameo scene in the final minute of the movie. This movie took us on a journey, and although at the end it felt like a long road, my one and only concern is that I feel like I don't know what the purpose of this movie is. And this drives me nuts. I think I do know but nothing is clear. And the thing is that I really cannot disregard the journey I was on, but it sure feels like Scorsese needed to tell us something but the message did not pass through. Who is the protagonist in the movie? Is it Deniro or DiCaprio? It sure as hell cannot be Gladstone. And that is my issue with this movie. It builds a momentum and it sure feels like Gladstone is the key for the break out of this build up, but the explosion never comes and the momentum simply is lost. And what was this all about you ask? I really am not sure. Scorsese sheds a light on a part of American history I was ignorant about but does he do more than that? I'm not sure.",positive
299,"Please, let's stop complaining about the length of the movie, he actually took the time to elaborate this point. It's vital to acknowledge that Hollywood and the film industry, in general, have become increasingly superficial, often churning out repetitive content (most of all in horrors, but that'snot the case). We live in a society where the average video lasts a mere 15 to 20 seconds, making it all too clear that our attention spans have dwindled. If dedicating three hours to a movie seems excessive to you, it's worth reflecting on whether that's a personal preference or a broader symptom of our modern, fast-paced culture.",positive
300,"Basically four hours of watching evil White men kill native Americans and abuse them in the worst ways to steal their land and oil. I could sum it up like this but reviews need more text. What can I say? Acting as usual with Dicaprio is decent, it's just another Scorsese film which I never found fascinating despite the obvious production values. On a pure entertainment level, I question why you would even enjoy watching such a film. It's four hours of tedium. And on the historical side, I wonder two questions: 1) Is there any proof that things truly happened in such a depraved way, and, 2) Where is hollywood responsibility for talking about such a heavy and important topic (genocide) in an accurate manner? I dislike that it was probably a plot used by Scorsese to cast Dicaprio his favorite actor once again. Just like with Howard Hughes, the plot is probably distorted massively for entertainment. I just personally question why watch this film at all. It's not entertaining history drama like by Ridley Scott. It's not a brutal modern cowboy film either. It's just a depressing movie with lots of talking, arguing, and a couple of killings. And four hours long.",positive
301,"He has made some mistakes in the past, but he also made some of the best cinema has to offer. This time he explores a dark time in American history, leaves the violence and foul language to moderate levels and gives a film, gorgeously shot, perfectly directed and magnificently acted.Of the three leads, Gladstone shines as Mollie, a woman whois perfectly aware and is frustrated because there is very little she can do to fix. Things become more unbearable, with her watching her family die one by one.and.her diabetes threatening her life. She matches DiCaprio step by step. She knows that he is trouble, yet she marries him.In a supporting but important role is De Niro as the master of darkness, creating an illusion for a public figure and scheming behind close doors what his next evil move will be. Again, not an ounce of overacting or screams, makes his performance rich and interesting.The film is relatively long.but it moves nicely with a haunting score balanced with quiet times to allow you to listen every line of dialogue.Killers has epic moments mixed with powerful quiet films where you can follow the rich details in the story. It is an experience that is memorable, powerful, and remarkable in all aspects.",positive
302,"Killers of the Flower Moon was a wide, sprawling and meticulously told story. Production design was amazing, cinematography was astounding. Martin Scorsese does some cool stuff like the epilogue and a little wink to Brian DePalma when Bill Hale is getting a shave. Leo, Deniro and Lily Gladstone all turn in great performances. You can feel the pain of Leonardo DeCaprio's character on the jail floor. He plays the indesiciveness of his characters extremely well. I think that editing is the only miss in this movie. Thelma Schoonmaker is one of the best editors to ever cut. Her craft is amazing. The pace of the first act of this film however is very very slow. That responsibility lands on the editor, especially one that has worked so closely with the director for decades.Overall this was a good watch when you are sitting in a theater giving it all of your attention. Streamers that are scrolling on their phones at home may find it boring and difficult to follow. Definitely worth the watch but not as rewatchable as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and The Departed.",positive

304,"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. Fantastic actors such as Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. Even Brendan Fraser and John Lithgow shows up at the end.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",positive
305,"No pun intended - the movie starts off with a setting that made me wonder if this plays in a parallel universe ... where native Americans (though of course in the movie they are called Indians, as was the case back then) actually have an upper hand. Even if only at a certain place in America.But quickly it becomes clear that while it does look like it on the surface - there is more going on in the background. This being based on a real story - I am not sure how Martin Scorsese did get in touch with the story. It is not his usual playing field is what some would say ... and yet he is made for it.As are Di Caprio and De Niro - what a pair, what a great chemistry. But the movie that is 3,5 hours long (it never feels stretched or boring at any point) has many other people on it that are able to shine. Some actors are only in it for a scene or a few minutes. One of the biggest surprises for me was ""Daredevils sidekick"" - better known as: Elden Henson. He does not even have any dialog in this. I assume there are quite a few deleted scenes - with him and probably many other people. But Scorsese thought he did not need them. That is me assuming of course.The story is quite harrowing - if you don't know about it, be prepared. Leo is not afraid to be ugly for this - in more than one sense. I was tempted to check out the real story behind this (the movie does give us a review of what happened during the credits), but there is so much negativity, I did not feel like checking it out. But Kudos to Apple and Scorsese and the actors for going all the way in for this. Well I think so, because the actors who play native Americans do seem like they actually are native Americans. I may be wrong - I did not check that out either.If you are up for an entertaining (US) history lesson - go for it!",positive
306,"As far as movie topics go, Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) felt like something that hadn't been addressed on film yet. I did not know about the Osage Nation's good (and bad) fortune until I saw this movie. So, on top of being educational about a historical subject that isn't talked about a lot, it also has the huge name of Martin Scorsese behind it as its director. And while it was an interesting film overall, I think Scorsese gets a bit too much leeway in this part of his career.Much like how I thought The Irishman (2019) was probably an hour too long, Killers of the Flower Moon could have easily had an hour trimmed from its almost 3.5-hour runtime. Of course, this seems to be an issue with well-known directors. Sure, their later works (like Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)) have critical acclaim and are good on paper. However, I think the editors for these directors early in their career helped them establish their status as talented filmmakers. Now, their films just seem bloated because nobody will tell them no.Acting wise, DiCaprio once again dives into an accent head first (much like his performance in Blood Diamond (2006)). De Niro is still just De Niro, but the standout performance came from Lily Gladstone. As for the plot, considering how rich white men have continued to screw up (and/or steal) everything around them, this movie is quite frustrating because they all got away with it. If they weren't still getting away with it to this day, maybe this film might have come off a little differently instead of just making me mad that there is so much injustice in this world.An overly long Scorsese film that highlights the continued greed of rich white men, I give Killers of the Flower Moon 3.5 stars out of 5.",positive
307,"I created an account during the movie just to rate the movie with one star. I can not recall the last time a movie did upset me like this one.The actors are great and the story is important, too. There are some important topics in the story. The movie is everything but not exciting. A lot of scenes are not important at all and the story could have been told in about 2 hours. It was boring and the happenings repeated. The last scene was a complete nonsense.I am very dissapointed, I had really big hopes on this one because of the importance of the topics. Sadly didn't got to watch the movie I have hoped for.",positive
308,"Don't get me wrong, the setting is phenomenal. Acting is top notch. Characterisation is on point. The biggest let down is the incredibly slow paced story; confusing plot lines and the absurd depiction of the Osage as a people who for some reason were ignorant of these killings until much later in the film. I mean, there's tribal people getting shot in the street and none of the Osage bring this up.At 3.5 hours it was like wading through treacle. I could have skipped half of it and wouldn't have missed anything significant.The FBI investigation was feeble and there was little in the way of drama or tension.One to miss.",positive
309,"Martin Scorsese has given us some classics but I've often felt just a slight edge which has lessened the 'greatness' of his best work. Not so here. The Killers of the Flower Moon is for me one of his most impressive achievements. It's a really absorbing though challengingly long 3.5 hour account of the true story of the crimes committed against the Osage Indians in the 1920s, the investigations of which were partly responsible for the birth of the FBI. Scorsese concentrates on the drama and relationships, but also he uses the saga to take us on a journey into the darker heart of America, the parts consumed by greed, jealousy, prejudice and ignorance. It's a remarkable achievement as it delivers the story and its message beautifully, carefully, and without excess, making it totally absorbing despite its extreme length. The film is both respectable of the Osage, and insightful in so many ways about its other protagonists, also cleverly drawing on the events of the period. The film features many brilliant performances, not the least Leonardo De Caprio, giving I think the best of his career and newcomer (to me) Lily Gladstone as the central characters in the drama, and Robert De Nero too is great as ever. Brilliantly constructed and written, Scorsese here avoids making any violence central to the action, and also avoids gratuitous violence, focusing instead on the human foibles and deep fault lines which created the events we see. He cleverly uses American culture and landscape to show us something truly fascinating and focused. Highly recommended.",positive
310,"I didn't know anything about this piece of American history, I'm not American, but I have to apologize to all Native Americans as I am a white man, it's not my fault, but I am ashamed of. This is a movie about what happened in 1920 in Oklahoma, but it perfectly depicts what still happens at our days. I'm not going to talk about that, because I'm here to say something about this movie. It's simply a very good film, and you won't easily forget it. Is it the best movie ever? No it's not, it's just a movie that for many reasons you won't forget, and after watching it, you'll agree with me, unless...
It talks about greed, power, lies, evil, injustice, racism, betrayal, hate, and of course, money. Among that some love too... true love? Maybe...It talks also about how easy was killing Native Americans, with the purpose of stealing their money, and not to be condemned, until the moment in which so many Native Americans were murdered that was impossible not to investigate about those deaths. Did the white man started to investigate, because of those murders? Of course not, the Native Americans had to go to the President, and asking for justice. What happened then? Did the Native Americans get full justice? Again, of course not, they weren't white men, they were Native Americans. However more or less, they got some justice, if we can call that, justice. Many people don't know that one day we all will pay for our bad actions, and we'll get the right punishment. It calls Universal Justice, and there's no chance to escape.What was the reason why the white man started killing the Native Americans? Money, of course, but exactly why? The discovery of ""black gold"" on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation, and suddenly they got rich.It wasn't acceptable, they were savages, not civilized people like the white man, so some ""good"" white men decided that they had to get some of that money at any costs. So they started to kill the Natives.Now it's time for you to see what really happened, and how.A very good cast, and a great director was able to make this movie possible... Robert De Niro, Leonardo Di Caprio, Lily Gladstone, and the director Martin Scorsese.It's very long, but believe me, you won't fell asleep.Enjoy!",positive
311,"Martin Scorsese's latest film --- an adaptation of David Gran's knockout-punch true crime bestseller about the ritualized murders of the Osage in the '20s --- is so structurally flawed and reverse engineered for maximum Double ""D"" star power that it dilutes itself on-screen. It's like watching a much-anticipated bouquet of roses wilt in an excruciatingly slow, slow time-lapse.It's hard to believe the change in POV narrative voice --- to that of the criminals than their victims --- was due to studio pressure, considering the length of the film's cut. Maybe because it was so ""surprising"" that DiCaprio would play such an unflattering part? In the book, the Osage come off as anything but passive victims. It's not easy to be locked into the first two hours with the villains, who are about as subtle as a gang of terrorists in wreaking their havoc. Even if you haven't read the book, the identity of the criminals is revealed almost immediately. In this age of famously arrogant and stupid public criminality, Scorsese might be drawing a parallel back to these felonious, greedy idiots (another problem for me, the villains are quite simply, just morons). DiCaprio and DeNiro's performances never make these maroons remarkable.The movie doesn't really spark until way past the two-hour point, when Jesse Plemons' G-Man character drops a super-cool Dirty Harry-esque four-word retort as to his mission (""See who's doin' it"") to DiCaprio's question as to why he's on his doorstep. Yet even then, the cat and mouse game proceeds in somewhat slow-motion. There are a lot of long pauses in many of the line readings... why, who knows? (""Quiet, I'm acting?"")This is not a bad film by any means. I just prefer Scorsese's movies when he's more in show-off mode (""After Hours"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Departed""). And there's some of that inventive virtuosity here --- several marvelous zooms and sweeping pan-outs, the ingenious double-eye motif at the start and glorious finish. And the radio show coda is both phenomenal and tear-inducing. Sixty years on, Martin Scorsese's films deserve every bit of the A-list attention they get.Who knows? Maybe there are layers here I haven't uncovered. I hated Kubrick's The Shining when I first saw it 43 years ago and think now that he meant to subvert the source material rather than interpret it. But the Shining was fiction. A watershed book like Gran's seems to merit a more faithful transition to the screen, at least on first viewing, for me.",positive
312,"First of all it was a great comeback from The Irishman which I find it extremely long and winded with all the cast aging but still acts like a youngsterSo we come to the killlers of flower moon pack at almost 4 hours I use 2 days to finish the film.. it was great and the pacing was fast , the conversation between all the character's acted out like I was transported to Oklahoma..It was the first movie that I watched where the Indian were served by the white and it was hilariousLeonardo acted perfectly and on point as Ernest
Robert De Niro as the plot master played it really well
Lily Gladstone as Mollie was superb and show deserve a Oscar nomination for her role
Brendan Fraser & Martin Scorsese cameo appearance were marvellousThe ending of the movie was a show and tell us something fresh tooOverall it was a great comeback from Marty..",positive
313,"I love Martin Scorsese, and I really appreciate why and how he made this film. It was an unexpected treat seeng him do a brief little introduction before the movie started to thank everybody for coming and supporting the project. The performances by all of the actors were what you would expect --excellent. But at 3 1/2 hours, and a basically unsatisfying conclusion in that they never really did solve these murders, I left the theater wanting more closure. I also have to say that I just don't enjoy going to the theater as much as I used to. This is no reflection on the film itself, but the experience isn't what it was in the past. People have become such jerks and insist on behaving like they're watching a movie in their living room rather than in a public space with 100 other people. For 3 1/2 hours I had to listen to the guy next to me audibly sigh repeatedly and progressively louder, check his backlight bright blue watch, and squirm in his chair. He was a much older man who should have known better. And my husbands left, there was another older woman who sounded like she should've been in a tuberculosis unit. We listen to a thick, wet cough (naturally, she never bothered to cover her mouth) for the whole duration of the film. It really wasn't pleasant, and I don't know what to do about that other than to just stop going to the movies.",positive
314,"We were very delighted to go see this phenomenal movie in a nearby theater. Not that the movie is ""delightful,"" since it is very grim. What it is, is - very concerned with historical reality, very relevant to our current situation, very well acted, very wonderfully filmed, and very sensitive to the disastrous oppression and lethality to the experience of American ""Indian"" peoples and their culture.There are many things to praise about it. I was immediately emotionally knocked over by the magnificense of Scorsese's style. Though there were some deliberately shocking scenes of violence, that was only secondary to the narrrative and the depiction of the characters. DeCaprio's acting could not be called ""subtle"" because he was not playing a subtle character at all. DeNiro was of course DeNiro, and called to mind extremely the evil exploiters of hstory as well as those we know all to well in our present day. Jesse Plemons - a fine actor, and he was ""subtle.""
Soundtrack - a pervasive use of drumbeats and snippets of folk and country/Western tunes to underscore the dramatic action.An interesting scene near the close - no spoiler! - that sort of breaks the fourth wall and pins down what it's all been about.No way to overestimate the performance of Lily Gladstone!",positive
315,"While this is one of the less impressive and less favorite Scorsese movies of mine that I've seen and while the plot sometimes gets a little too distracted with its story-telling for its own good (mainly with the crimes and characters), there are several good things. I always love Leonardo DiCaprio's acting plus Scorsese's directing and quality production behind the scenes, and the dramatic moments that aren't easy to forget. Lily Gladstone gave a pretty good performance as well. While the film goes on for quite some time, you become invested enough and I did not know much about this story and what happened with this event and so I was more surprised when it ended the way it did.",positive
316,"You might've heard a lot about this film in recent weeks. Most of you would probably know why. It's directed by the great Martin Scorsese and it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. The Departed, which had a similar genre, was also directed by Scorsese and starred DiCaprio and it's one of my all time favourite films.This film confirms that Scorsese has a knack for consistently making tremendous films in the crime/suspense genre.But let's forget the names of the cast and the staff. How is this movie? I think this is old-fashioned filmmaking and storytelling at its best. With this and Oppenheimer, we as cinephiles are just very lucky in 2023.Let's start with the structure. This is a 3.5 hour long movie. Yup, 210 minutes. Personally, I'm completely fine with that. The first 2.5 hours provide a very slow and somewhat frustrating build up to this tragic story. The slow pace makes you even more involved and horrified by what's happening. You get even more frustrated at these characters because of the slowness. That makes the final hour all the more worth it. Scorsese also has a habit of making the payoffs of his movies very entertaining to watch.The script is brilliantly written. It's one of the few cases where I forget that I'm watching a movie while listening to these characters. Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro give very memorable performances. The soundtrack was great too. For the first 2 hours, it's mostly just 1 slow theme playing in the bg. That was clever since it created the eerie vibe that was supposed to be there in the first 2 acts. It added to the slow pace as well.Scorsese's direction as always, is brilliant. I also enjoyed how he chose to conclude this story in the final 10 mins.I know there are criticisms for the runtime of this film and I sort of understand why some people wouldn't want to sit in the theatre for that long. But I'd still really, really suggest you to watch this in the theatres if you can. These aren't movies that you get easily nowadays, and a chance of watching a Scorsese film on the big screen isn't worth missing.",positive
317,"The good: Beautiful movie, with a truly authentic feel to it. The bad: Despite way too long there are still some unclear 'jumps' in telling the tale. The ugly: Looking at Di Caprio this long proves to be challenging due to the fact that for this role he adjusted his facial expression. Save one scene, where he seems to have forgotten. He looks like the aged Godfather, something Scorsese might actually like. Nit after and jour or two your own face starts to hurt. The best part (no spoiler alert) is near the end and is very original. We need to send a message here that these movies can be very long but needn't be. It's just too much. Imagine Back to the Future parts 1,2 and 3 being shown in one long feature? It just doesn't work and spoils the experience.",positive
318,"Martin Scorsese recently complained about people that complained over the run time of his new movie Killers of The Flower Moon. If that complain should have any substance he gotta make it better than this. Because the movie is really too long-drawn out, heavy on the dialogue and it's really a dragged affair ending with his bizzare crime play to sum up the movie by the ending, which is just cheesy at best and adds to the very long run time. If it had been filled with more excitement it had been no problem, but this movie really bores you with it's heavy usage of voice-over reminiscent of what Scorsese did in Casino. You see some decent acting from De Niro and Di Caprio and the movie really starts better than it ends, with the story of the Osage that reels you in, but at the same time the investigations into murders and repeating the same stories over and over again, just does not hold you interested the way you should be in a longer movie like this. A lot of people are sceptical of the run time and it don't really think watching it will kill the sceptisism.I had expected it to be more violent and vivid and although there are some violence it is very short in it's appearance and the movie itself is miles of Scorsese's best work like Cape Fear and The Wolf of Wall Street. The investigation and the sequences with De Niro and Di Caprio being in jail does drag it out a lot, and the story may be told a lot more from Osage perspective, but it is also really annoying that it's not texted properly, a lot of the time you do not actually translate what the Osage are saying.. Maybe some people may call this movie artwork, some may label it an oscar movie. But for me it is a very boring movie that I do not neccessarily regret that I went to, but I have seen a lot of better movies than this. Although Scorsese may be proud of this movie to me it's perhaps the most overrated movie this year because people have been talking it up all year. To me at least there was no real hard good reason for that. Because although the story was interesting the movie tries to tell way too much without having too much substance. What could also have done is to short it down at least an hour, tone down the heavy dialogue because a lot of it just dragges the movie and scale up the violence. For me personally it's a 5/10 a quite large dissapointment. But you may of course like it better.",positive
319,"WOW. That was fantastic.What a time to be alive and experience once again an amazing movie directed by the 80 y.o. Martin Scorsese. The one and only. The best of the best.I think everyone should watch this movie. It is an important story to be told and it's unfortunately very sad that all of that happened (in some way). I've learn so much.The cast was i-n-c-r-e-d-i-b-l-e. It will forsure be nominated for a bunch of Academy Awards. The cinematography, the costumes and the score were perfection.Of course the movie was very long BUT I only felt that in the last 30 minutes or so. Overall, there was no scenes that was too long. I recommend to be very comfortable while watching this.",positive
320,"If you're still puzzled by ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" (2023), it might be easier to first understand the director. Scorsese has his own unique formula of story telling, and almost routinely presents his audiences with what I'd describe as an ""interior view,"" one in which the narrator describes the actions and thoughts of the characters. Great examples of this style can be seen in several of his iconic films such as ""Goodfellas"" (1990) and Casino (1995), where he unfolds the plot, characters, dialogue, and almost always, a not so subtle theme of violence.There's nothing subtle about ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" and there is nothing mysterious or hidden here. The bad guys operate in plain sight, and like the source book by author David Gann, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a sad tale of men who approach murder with disquieting ease.There's no need to discuss the plot here as many other IMDb reviewers have already contributed this information. Essentially, this is about the Osage Nation, and how, after being ruthlessly pushed off their own land, serendipitously find their ""new home"" bursting with oil. And practically overnight, they went from poverty to wealth. Of course, the same men who displaced the Osages then decided they wanted the resulting wealth and profits. The result isn't pretty, and it is not meant to be.Although his place in film history has already been decided, Robert De Niro delivers the most powerful performance of his storied career. His sociopathic and violent portrayal of a very disgusting human being is truly riveting, and Leonardo DiCaprio, no acting slouch himself, perfectly gaslights what is already a hostile scenario.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" may not be for everyone. But the depth and diversity of this slow paced, well conceived film, will surely pick up several well deserved Oscar nominations.No spoilers here as usual for me (why ruin the fun?) but I can reveal that the subsequent investigation into Osage County was the first case presented to the newly formed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) led by J. Edgar Hoover.",positive
321,"Felt more lika a historylesson than a entertaining movie.And with that said i do appreciate history, and also longer movies if it so may be Ben Hur or Lawrence of the Arabia. But they could have cut it down with atleast 1 hour.First hour i just accepted it being null with the hope that is was building for something thrilling, but the rest of the movie do step up a but all in all a big disapointment.Also sadly even if it futures some of the greatest actors of our time, they still do quality work but at the same time nowere near their greatest acting performance. More like Leo and Robert just seemed to be contempt finally getting to do something together for once.",positive
322,"Over the last few years, a lot of attention has been given to the Tulsa Massacre, wherein white mobs razed a black neighborhood in Tulsa to the ground. It turns out that a series of equally vicious deeds took place in Oklahoma around that time: the Osage Murders. Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" focuses on that.The US government had forced a number of indigenous peoples onto reservations in Oklahoma under the assumption that the land was worthless. Upon discovering oil on the land, the indigenous peoples became wealthy. It wasn't long before a number of the indigenous people started turning up dead, with the murders going unsolved. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a man carrying out a number of murders at the behest of his uncle, played by Robert DeNiro.Criticism of the movie is about its long runtime and the emphasis on the characters played by DiCaprio and DeNiro as opposed to the Osage themselves. Whatever the case, I thought that the movie did a good job addressing the story. Special praise should go to Lily Gladstone as the woman whose family owned oil headrights, and whom DiCaprio's character married.Even if you interpret the movie as a simply morality play, it's still a look at an important - and suppressed - part of our country's history. I recommend it.",positive
323,"I knew that I was going to fight the duration of this film but I never expected to do so to this extent. The first two hours went by as expected, a slowly brewing plot with many characters on scene. It is there where Scorsese shines providing us with a privileged scope into this period of American history filled with corruption, intrigues and colourful people. None of the assassinations made me connect with the gloom atmosphere though because lives were clearly a not so valuable thing those days so no surprises there.It is then when we arrive before the two central pillars that hold this film problems sky high for us to see them. One, the inability for me to feel some kind of relatability with the grief these Indians suffered during the assassinations due to their already corrupt nature. Thus, if we decide to see this just as a curious story and not as a biopic of an injustice, the second great problem is its rhythm. I find unacceptable that after three hours of an already tremendously slow film we must put up with the trial part, completely uninspired and putting a cherry on top of the pie such as that final little theatrical representation in what I consider one of the worst ways of ending a story I have ever seen depriving of the little strength the story had to just trivialise its characters ending journeys.It all makes up for a true forgettable experience.",positive
324,"Yes, this is a long movie. But I don't think there's anything wrong with that except for the lack of patience in viewers. It's a complicated, difficult story of bad nature of people, it has to be told in a detailed, long way. It makes you love them, than hate them, be frustrated. It takes so long for justice to come, just like in real life, let's be honest, so it has to be a long movie. Nothing comes fast, no drama, no happiness and no justice come easy and fast. Leo did an amazing job, and De Niro made me hate him so much, I don't think I can look at his face any time soon, so, hi played his role perfectly. Just like I imagine all the wealthy villains today that have people on strings like puppets. And the naivety of Leo, and blind love of Mollie perfectly portraits the human nature.It's not a movie to watch with half a brain and feel relaxed after. It's a piece of art. I loved it.",positive
325,"I walked into Killers of the Flower Moon with high expectations, given the powerhouse names behind it-Scorsese, DiCaprio, De Niro. The premise, too, was intriguing: a dark chapter of American history, ripe for a compelling and thought-provoking narrative. But as the credits rolled, I found myself feeling more underwhelmed than captivated. One of the film's main challenges is its pacing. At nearly three and a half hours long, it's clear that Killers of the Flower Moon is aiming for an epic scope. But instead of feeling like an expansive journey through time, the film often drags. Scenes that could have been sharp and impactful are instead stretched out, lingering too long on moments that lose their urgency. I found myself checking the time more than once, wondering when it would pick up again. DiCaprio and De Niro deliver solid performances, but even their star power can't entirely compensate for the film's sluggish middle act. There's a sense that the movie is trying to do too much, and in the process, it loses focus on what should be its core; the osage people's story. Visually, the film is stunning; The cinematography captures the stark beauty of the American Midwest. There are moments of brilliance scattered throughout the film, where you can see glimpses of what Killers of the Flower Moon could have been. But those moments are too few and far between to sustain the film's hefty runtime. Ultimately, while I appreciate the ambition behind the project, the final product feels more like a missed opportunity than a masterpiece.",positive
326,"""The Killers of the Moon"" is a cinematic epic that confirms Martin Scorsese's position as one of the most outstanding directors in the history of cinema. With impressive photography, Scorsese transports us to a time and place that evokes the emotion of a classic epic.The movie tells the story of the formation of the United States of America, revealing the values and beliefs that have defined the nation, as well as the anti-values that have been fundamental to its formation.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is outstanding, playing a believable and detestable character. The performances overall are formidable, with a cast that successfully conveys the complexity and darkness of their characters in a convincing way.Although it's not Scorsese's best work, ""The Killers of the Moon"" is a movie that leaves a mark and ages well. It's a film that allows us to better understand the complexity of America's history and its impact on today's society.With a complex narrative and formidable performances, ""The Killers of the Moon"" is a masterpiece that cannot be missed. A movie that makes us reflect on history and morality, and leaves us with a sense of admiration and respect for Scorsese's skill.",positive
327,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a true story about greed and racial violence that evidences the lengths people are willing to go to fulfill their needs.While I totally support Martin's intentions to showcase the oppression against minority groups, I found the narrative repetitive and lackluster. I believe that a masterpiece is as long as it needs to be but I'm convinced that the 3h30 runtime isn't justified for the presented screenplay. However, the production and costume design are superb and the viewer definitely gets to travel back in time.In short, I was hoping for more mystery, tension and thrilling moments but it's still a well crafted movie from a legendary director starring an iconic duo. Nonetheless, both De Niro and DiCaprio have put out better performances.",positive
328,"I went into the theater with a lot of the hype I was hearing from critics, however I was disappointed. The story of the Osage nation is tragic, and specifically the family shown in the film. The problem is that in the 3.5 hour duration of the film, you will already know the story, characters and their arc, all within 30-45 minutes. There just wasn't enough that kept my mind engaged for the duration of the film, or me on the edge of my seat. Simply put, it was boring. I checked the clock multiple times to see how much longer was left. I was thinking that maybe towards the end of the film there could be a big payoff for the viewer, but it wasn't like that.A similar type of film set on this landscape like ""There will be blood"" was a true masterpiece compared to this.If you're on the fence about seeing this in theaters, I would recommend waiting for streaming on Apple TV instead.",positive
329,"The movie works. As a storytelling device more so than a movie, but substance over style seldomly is a bad thing. Drab, bleak, boring, dull..., uneasy are emotions it conjures up over its running time, all the while the plotdesign is so expertly crafted, that after its all said an done, I cant help but to get the feeling that it was to a large extend intentionally driven.There is a ""showing the audience the door is open, then telling it the door is open"" in voiceover (not to be taken literally) moment quite early on, in the earlier parts of the first third of the move, that drives home to the audience what is happening here. There is no mystery - there just is purpose and greed. Then you get introduced to the main cast, then the likeable characters, and then you wait.And the agony starts building. Come one, we know whats going to happen, let it happen. But the uneasiness is building. Then its happening, but we know it isnt over at this point, so now the agony starts building again, then it happens again, and its a little more painful, because the characters it happens to were a bit more sincere or likeable than before. And thats the loop of the movie. At the moment it is happening to the main character we always knew it would be happening too, the presentation makes it alla blur, and really elongates the moment, then intercuts with second story plot - while in the background we still have the lingering feeling, wait - this is still happening, right?Then comes the Deus Ex machina which almost didnt happen because of ""istitutional reluctance to give 300 USD"", as a result of a character overcoming unbelievable odds, then we learn that the Deus Ex machina was bought with 20.000 dollars.Then comes in the cavelary, and then the excuses start to get stripped away. Wait, that was a likeable fellow, right? Eight kids. But with a redskin it was different. No, no I'm just asking if it is legal and I'd get the money, if I dont get the money I would not do it. Then the matter of factness gets layered in. Yes he held her, and set her up and I shot. You didnt happen to loose the bullet, ""carving the flesh from the bone""?And then we are in the middle of the main characters character struggle. Never quit likeable, always uneasy. Then the main character makes all the wrong decisions as part of that character struggle, but no word is said, no word is uttered to him - even by his wife. He choses to stay on side of main antagonists logic for a little while longer. Then simply unfolds what we as an audience know would unfold. Someone close to his heart dies. Which was foreshadowed by the storytelling.Then comes the change of heart. Leonardo di Caprio finally beating the struggle. All the while making up a self concept of his actions that makes it bearable. And then it comes down to a final question. What was it that you gave me.And everything, the entire structure of the redemption arc breaks down at once.The point is, if you look into the structure of it, it always was intended to move along that arc. Dont go to the doctors, go to the train, get the insulin directly from there. ""You'll be next"". What was it that you gave me. The entire selfimage the character has at that point, the hope of the heroes arch isnt worth a penny. I thought long and hard how I, the viewer, would weasel myself out of this situation, and the answer is I cant. ""It was my uncle."" ""It was my uncle having power over me"". ""I did it because of the love of the family."" ""I dindt understand."" ""I did it because of the children."" ""I thought it would just relax you"". None of it is possible - its all stripped away by plotdesign.Its failure set up.And its so obvious, that the heart of the film and the ""good detective"" dont even have to say anything. The lie is laid bare. The good (person) and the hero seperate.To come to that point, no convincing is needed. The hero is led along that path using ""what will you do next"" open questions at the moment of his last wrong decision which he then reverses because of the emotional quandaries that follow after the final death, that gets to him.And then the movie has to break to talk to the audience. Because all the while the parallel powerstructure was explained alongside (""keeping a secret part of free masonry"", ""brotherhood of the clan""), and in real life, that power structure one upped the storytelling. If the hero didnt change his mind in the end, he would have been better off.And there is really nothing to say to that. So this is when the director has to explain this to us, the viewer. Here lies a women. She blossomed one more time, seperated from the ""hero"", she survived her Sister, her other sister, her child. Nothing on the gravestone talks about societies nature, or even that there were murders.To get that to hit in a ""more fast paced movie"" is not possible.Find the wolf in the picture.The cinematography sometimes was lacking, the ""highs"" (""falling in love/dependance"") could have been more accentuated. De Niro is maybe the only one that always feels spot on, its not a perfect movie, not perfect in an entertaining sense - but then it doesnt try to be.For a 200 mio USD movie, thats quite something, actually.So for not being a perfectly directed movie, when its a Scorsese - I deduct a few points. But everyone knew what they were doing here.I think.And if that translates to an audience as boring, well - cant fault the audience right? ;) And you also cant fault substance over style.",positive
330,"This film clocks in at THREE AND A HALF HOURS! This could've been released as a limited series on HBO in four 50 minute episodes. The film really lost a lot of its power because it is simply too long. I watched it on a long haul flight, otherwise there was no way I could sit down and find the time to make it through the entire thing! The story itself is compelling and deeply disturbing. The story of the Osage murders should be known by every American. The novel should be required reading in every school! The set design, costumes, acting were all impeccable. I've seen others say that Lily Gladstones performance was underwhelming, I thought it was incredible. You can see her physical transformation as she is being poisoned. DiCaprio and Deniro really deliver as the unspeakably cruel masterminds of this plan. One small note, I hated Scorsese's cameo at the end of the film.. totally took me out of it and was such an odd note to end such a powerful story on. Overall, should be watched, but I would recommend splitting it into two parts. The first part is really focused on the murder of the Osage people, and the second part is about the FBI getting involved.",positive
331,"For as much as Killers of the Flower Moon is new territory for Martin Scorsese, it is also something new. Flower Moon seems to combine Scorsese's longtime interest in the corrupt underbelly of American society (Wolf of Wall Street, The Irishman, etc.), which also considering his more recent interest in the clashes between Western culture and others (Silence). It is also Scorsese's entrance to the Western genre. In this movie, a group of settlers conspire to rob the Osage Native American tribe of their oil and land, which has made them very wealthy. This was one of the cases that led to the founding of the FBI. Westerns have changed over the years. The romanticism of the Wild West has been supplanted by moral dilemmas. Flower Moon falls solely in the latter, as one may expect.This movie is also notable as it stars Scorsese's two most frequent collaborators, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert de Niro, together under Scorsese's direction for the first time. Leo was alright in this movie. He plays Ernest Burkhart, who seems conflicted between actual love for Mollie, an Osage woman. Compared to his performances in other Scorsese movies like Shutter Island and Wolf of Wall Street, this one was rather lacking. Robert de Niro was quite good in his role as William Hale, the ringleader. Despite his actions and true intentions he gives the vibe of a caring grandfather figure. However, if there's one standout performance, it's that of Lily Gladstone. She plays the role of Mollie, an Osage woman who marries Ernest and progressively loses her family to the conspiracy. It's very difficult to portray a person completely bereft without falling into dull underacting, and that's precisely what she avoids here. Mollie represents the last stand of the Osage values and the refusal to give in to a decadent lifestyle, and it is masterfully portrayed by Gladstone.The production itself is quite impressive. The whole town looks very authentic. Everything from the costumes to the decor of any interior to the vintage cars makes the movie very immersive. Without going into story details, the explosion in the movie is an actual explosion, which is very impressive. The way the film ends, while it may not have tonally fit it, was a unique showcase of an antiquated form of entertainment.One thing must be addressed: the runtime. It's over three and a half hours long. It's Scorsese's longest movie, beating out his second most recent, The Irishman. There are some movies where you don't feel the runtime; this isn't one of them. This movie may have been better as a miniseries. That would have given it more time to fully develop more characters, and distribute time more evenly. The Irishman at least has the benefit of a much faster pace, and a focus solely devoted to one main character. With Flower Moon, it's good content, but when it moves at a slower pace and shifts focus, it's easy to lose focus.Ultimately, Killers of the Flower Moon is far from Scorsese's best work, which isn't saying much given the excellence of his repertoire. It is worth a watch, although perhaps in pieces rather than one go.",positive
332,"The film is based on a true story and book by the same name. Native Americans were herded into Oklahoma on worthless land. Then oil was discovered and became valuable in the age of World Wars and the automobile. The Osage sign a royalty contract and they all become wealthy with rights being passed on. Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a modest veteran of the war who becomes both the protagonist and antagonist. He meets up with his uncle ""King William Hale"" of the Osage County. Native American women have been marrying white men and then they quickly die leaving the rights to their husbands robbing the Natives of their money. William Hale is in the middle of the planning. When the FBI is called in, Ernest must quickly decide what is right.The courtroom drama could have been done better. The many killings and connections became boring and confusing. The screen adaptation was not good in this regard.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",positive
333,"I had not read the book, but I listened to over 10 hours of podcasts so I was anxious to see the flick. It grinds slowly but it is mostly a slalom down a creepy morality slope. De Niro as Hale is just creepy and hard to believe. That anyone could be that corrupt and malicious, while simultaneously feigning love and righteousness is hard to fathom. The acting is absolutely outstanding. I'm glad I spent the money and time to watch it. I did not think the movie was preachy and it showed genuine grief and horror from the perspective of the Osage. The more you learn about the actual story, the more you wonder about the European settlers and their sense of entitlement and their hunger for power. Make some popcorn and keep the remote handy for bio breaks. üëçüëç",positive
334,"Martin Scorsese's startling and ominous epic about a corrupt Oklahoma family whose patriarch undertakes the murders of various Osage tribal women for monetary gain starts out in haunting fashion and becomes more and more gripping but then somehow in the late phases, suddenly starts to feel like Heaven's Gate because of its running time.The film regains its momentum with a powerful conclusion worthy of the yeomen effort that went into this. Nevertheless, it is incomprehensible that Scorsese would allow such a powerful film of his (arguably his best in a long time) to almost get derailed by his lack of discipline and apparent unwillingness to be economical. His longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker once again proves to be a minimal factor.In terms of performances, DiCaprio and De Niro are commanding but it is Lily Gladstone who steals the film with a vividly anguished portrayal of the Osage wife whose loyalty and trust in her husband comes at an appalling cost. The supporting cast is also strong. Jesse Plemons is well-deployed as the dogged FBI agent who creeps up on things. Brendan Fraser makes a delightful turn as the family's oily, menacing defense attorney. There are homages to Scorsese's past work in certain scenes. But this film overall does not earn its running time and therefore its rating takes a slight knock. Still, recommend to history buffs and cinema buffs.",positive
335,"Killers of the Flower Moon,"" directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, explores the Osage murders in the 1920s. The film depicts the true story of a series of murders of members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma, who were among the wealthiest people per capita in the world due to oil deposits on their land.The performances in the movie are highly praised, with Leonardo DiCaprio delivering a captivating portrayal of a federal agent investigating the murders and Robert De Niro showcasing his acting prowess in a pivotal role. The supporting cast, including Jesse Plemons and Lily Gladstone, also received acclaim for their performances, adding depth to the narrative.Visually, the film is stunning, capturing the beauty of the Osage Nation lands and the tension that pervaded the community during that tumultuous time. Martin Scorsese's direction is lauded for its attention to detail and the way he brings the historical events to life on screen.The screenplay, adapted from David Grann's book of the same name, effectively conveys the complexities of the case and the systemic injustices faced by the Osage people. The narrative unfolds in a compelling manner, keeping viewers engaged and invested in the outcome.The film's score, composed by frequent Scorsese collaborator Robbie Robertson, enhances the emotional depth of the story and complements the on-screen action seamlessly. The cinematography, captured by Rodrigo Prieto, adds to the immersive experience, transporting viewers to the 1920s and immersing them in the world of the Osage Nation.Overall, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a masterful cinematic experience that sheds light on a dark chapter in American history. The performances, direction, cinematography, and storytelling all come together to create a memorable viewing experience that resonates long after the credits roll.",positive
336,"This movie was good, but went on for way too long. The acting is great, the cinematography is good, and the story is also good. The last hour of the movie could have been shortened to 20 minutes. I felt like there were a lot of scenes that didn't need to be in the movie. I got kinda bored after a while. I thought it was going to be much better. Also, a thing that I didn't like was that some of the stuff that happened was stupid. It didn't really come together and just became some random event. Nothing exciting or eventful really happened. In a way, it was kind of a missed opputunity. Still a decently good movie though.",positive
337,"Someone has to say it so it might as well be me, this movie is boring, very boring, I would rather do my tax-returns whilst listening to a politicians' debate than endure it again. I left the movie theatre after two and half-hours and should have done it sooner. Why?1 You don't get to identify with any of the characters or really grasp why each character is doing what they are doing. The characters just don't develop in the movie, they just interact with each other and more characters are added into the mix to distract from this.2 I love the actors and director individually, but you get the sense they are all in the equivalent of one of those old British phone boxes trying to move around - and there isn't room. They are simply too big for the little they have to work with. It's like you have three famous chefs and you give them a can of beans, a potato and a stick of celery and say 'Right, your all good at what you do, make me a great meal'.3 Historically this is very selective with the truth and facts and let's leave it there or this review would go on for pages. What can be said is that the Osage are in many ways their own worst enemy, but leaving that aside that they currently own, amongst many other assets, seven casinos which turnover hundreds of millions of dollars per annum. So if they were ever exploited, the shoe is on the other foot now.4 With such a high IMDB rating most people will go and see this and ignore low ratings like myself, but when that little voice in your head says 'God, this is boring...' then get up and go and cut your losses, because it will only get worse.",positive
338,"I am so glad this story of the Osage was told, 10/10 for shining a light on it. Lily Gladstone's performance was 1000/10. However, the movie was too long and too focused on Ernest and Hale. It's my understanding that the novel is based more upon their relationship, but for this film, the relationships that deserved focus, development, and emotional attachment with the audience were those between Mollie and her family and the Osage. Lily is such an amazing actress that she was able to get the audience to feel the pain, suffering, and courage of Mollie, despite having a screenplay that gave little time and attention to developing a connection between Mollie's family/community and the audience.Media (news, Hollywood, social media) focuses too much on perpetrators and their victims as the victim of the perpetrator; there is little to no focus or development of the victim as an individual with relationships, purposes, struggles. This movie was not much different from that trend.I'm also afraid the audience will go away thinking the system that paved the way for these abuses is a thing of the past. It is not. The allotment system is alive and well. There is some variation from region to region, tribe to tribe, but generally most property within reservation boundaries is owned by the US gov in trust for the allottees and to a lesser extent owned by the tribes and in fee by people. Individuals only own a beneficiary interest in trust lands. If an allottee wants to own the property in fee (i.e. Actually own the ground they're entitled to and not just a beneficiary interest) and thus have the ability to sell and use it as they wish, the BIA has to approve it, which includes a determination that the allottee is ""competent."" Today, in 2024, under Biden/Harris, the US government still works from a presumption that Native Americans are incompetent. This is beyond despicable. Also, like in the 20s, states have no jurisdiction/authority within reservations, and the feds don't pay much attention to policing even the things they do have authority to. There are many complex issues that could have used some more exploration in the film but at the least, it did increase some awareness to these issues and its success helped elevate Native talent.",positive
339,"We mere mortals should not be allowed to criticise the works of the gods. It never ends well. Scorsese sits up there at the summit of Mt. Olympus, even before his obituary date, so who am I to dare point to what is the big flaw of his latest wort, The killers of the flower moon: it's excruciatingly slow. The master is so entrenched in his... let's say style, that he doesn't care at all for the ever decreasing attention span of his viewers. Do they get tired after the first hour? It's Netflix, they will branch on later on. This movie could have been an absolute masterpiece with a bit more emotion and one hour less (minumum) running time. Leo does his best to impersonate Don Vito Corleone with an Okie accent (the mumbling, Marlon don Vito), but, the Ernest character is just... well... nothing. De Niro is De Niro. He can't be bad, but Bill Hale is... well... he should be evil, shouldn't he? Or come across as such, give that impression at least. Anyway. In spite of these tiny teeny criticisms of mine, I still give an 8 to the movie,mostly for the Osage people. That should be it.",positive
340,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a film that straddles the line between a grand historical epic and an intimate character study, directed with meticulous care by Martin Scorsese. The film tackles a harrowing chapter of American history, delving into themes of greed, betrayal, and the exploitation of the Osage Nation. While the narrative is undeniably compelling, its ambitious scope occasionally leads to pacing issues, with some parts feeling drawn out and lacking the tension needed to fully engage the viewer.Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro deliver powerful performances, though the depth of their characters sometimes feels overshadowed by the film's complex plot. However, the film's visual and auditory elements are stunning, with cinematography that beautifully captures the American Midwest and a score that subtly enhances the atmosphere.In summary, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a monumental piece of cinema-rich in historical significance and filled with strong performances-yet it may leave some viewers wanting a deeper emotional connection. It's a film that commands respect and offers much to reflect on, even if it doesn't fully realize its potential to resonate on a deeply personal level.",positive
341,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a 2023 film by Martin Scorsese.The USA in the 1920s: A lot of oil was found in the territory of the Osage Nation in the state of Oklahoma, which is why the indigenous peoples of North America living there have become very wealthy. But the white settlers are also after the black gold, especially the influential rancher William Hale (Robert De Niro) and his nephew Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is married to the Osage Mollie (Lily Gladstone). There are suddenly more and more deaths among the members of the Osage tribe, which seem to be somehow connected to the coveted oil drilling rights. This triggers a large-scale investigation by a completely new police unit - the FBI. Tom White (Jesse Plemons), a former Texas Ranger and old-school law enforcement officer, leads the investigation for the new federal agency and stumbles into a hornet's nest of corruption and murder...Martin Scorsese gives us the devastating psychological profile not only of a few killers, but of an entire society that, with the greatest self-confidence and without any sense of guilt, believes it is simply taking back what is naturally and God-given to it anyway. Instead of guessing in typical true crime fashion who the perpetrators really are, ""Killers Of The Flower Moon"" turns out to be an indictment of the - probably not only historical - circumstances, driven by the honest fury of its creator. Scorsese not only tells the story of exploited indigenous people, but also a lot about the fictional exploitation that can be transferred to our society today.",positive
342,"I should start by saying I'm a big Martin Scorsese and Leo DiCaprio fan. Robert DeNiro I feel isn't on the level of his Goodfellas/Casino prime nowadays but in many aspects a Scorsese/dicaprio/deniro project is a dream team and so I had been justly looking forward to Killers of the Flower Moon for some time.The cinematography is really well done and the movie is beautifully shot. Scorsese also lets characters breathe a bit and react in a scene instead of constantly cutting which is something more movies should let themselves do these days.The acting is top drawer. I mean it should be given the cast and they don't disappoint . Lily Gladstone is especially stellar as is Leo DiCaprio. It's also a welcome return to form and a more serious role for De Niro given his run of cash-grabs in his retirement age.Everything is competently done and well executed it just...goes on for a bit too long. And I'm not one to be put off by a long runtime - Scorsese's last epic The Irishman is of similar length, the aforementioned Casino, Oppenheimer this year all are 3/3+ hours and I have thoroughly enjoyed them. Killers of the Flower Moon though goes on for maybe 45min or so too long. It does strain to keep you engaged in the middle at times, and then as well somehow ends up feeling a bit rushed in wrapping the story up at the end.Overall I left a bit underwhelmed, perhaps my expectations were too high but that was almost inevitable given the talent involved. There's nothing egregious to point out, but a slightly trimmed runtime would have left a tighter feeling screenplay that engages throughout.",positive
343,"One reviewer described this film as 'a portrait of American evil' and that's quite an apt description. Like Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the many other countries colonised by English-speaking people, there exist founding myths in America that mask the original sin of racism and its long (and still present) reality. What is so confronting in the story of the Osage people in 1920s Oklahoma is that, while the wealth they generated from oil meant that they possessed all the accoutrements of modernity in terms of material possessions (including white chauffeurs) they were still hated by the white people who begrudgingly accepted their status. In spite of their material equality (and the higher social status) white men still considered killing an 'Indian' no different from killing a dog. Osage women were so hated that white men were prepared to marry them in order to gain the wealth of their inheritance rights. To marry them not out of love but out of pure greed and with murderous intent. The level of betrayal here is breathtaking in its enormity.Has there ever been a level of gaslighting on screen so overt as that displayed by William Hale (Robert De Niro) who masquerades as a respecter of Indigenous culture, speaks the Osage language, and wins the trust of Osage elders all the while conspiring to murder them and steal their wealth? In the hands of such an evil manipulator, the gormless Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DeCaprio) is easily wielded as a tool. Screenwriter Eric Ross wanted Jesse Plemons to play Burkhart and DiCaprio to play FBI agent Tom White. I think that would have worked fine but Scorsese flipped the roles and both give great performances. DiCaprio's frowning grimace (which seems to get more pronounced as the Feds apply more pressure on him) is an interesting affectation that I found a bit distracting but it does serve to reinforce the spineless stupidity of the character.Lily Gladstone is impressive as Mollie Burkhart who is really the centre of the story. Scorsese finds an interesting way to enter the film in a cameo role in a manner that is a touching tribute to Mollie's ancestors and to the Osage people. He gained the respect and trust of today's Osage elders who were glad that their story was being told in a way that would reach a wider audience than the book by David Grann on which the film is based. Unlike the protagonists of the film, he didn't betray that trust and with the assistance of the late Robbie Robertson (himself a Cherokee man) who wrote the score, and Osage advisers, Scorsese has done again what he has always done so well, applied a keen Catholic social conscience to the evil and violence that men do.Nominated for 10 Oscars including Best Film, Best Direction, Best Actress (Gladstone), Best Supporting Role (De Niro), and Best Cinematography (Rodrigo Pietro), Killers of the Flower Moon is probably not among Scorsese's best films, but a less than top-of-form Scorsese picture is better than most other people's efforts. As for the length, we should all be willing to spend 3 1/2 hours to educate ourselves about the history of Indigenous dispossession.",positive
344,"...but for me the outcome was somewhat less than the sum of its parts.One of Hollywood s most acclaimed directors at the helm of a cast chock full of acting talent; all in the service of what should be a compelling true story of racial injustice and exploitation. Throw in the origin story of the FBI for extra flavour- how could this not be a riveting even scintillating tale? Yet it's not. It's worthy yes! Well acted , of course! Looks great , I suppose so. But it is so one paced and soo! Long.Some have suggested KOTFM might work better as a mini series. Perhaps; but there have to be those moments of tension that compel viewers to watch the next episode. Not sure there enough of that here.For a long time I've felt Scorsese a little overrated. This film does little to change my view.",positive
345,"Scorcese knocks it out of the park with Killers of the Flower Moon. This is a non-woke, non box-ticking, unapologetic, true account of a gripping true crime story dating back to the early 1900s. I had seen the film advertised which made me finally get round to picking up the book. It's an unbelievable story- wealthy Indians getting murdered one by one, sparking terror in the community. The film was true to the book, down to the finest detail which made me realize how remarkable Scorcese's work really is. Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent as Ernest and even looked just like the pictures of the real life Ernest in the book. I found his face took on the same qualities. Robert DeNiro as Hale, the wealthy uncle and friend to the Indians was just as brilliant. They both emobodied the roles and offered complex and interesting performances. The actress who played Mollie also looked similar to the real pictures in the book and her acting was so soulful and sparing. I found the movie to be art, with all the painstaking attention to detail in bringing this story to life. I have lately got into watching the old westerns and classic cowboy films and this film possessed similar tones: classic, true, unapologetic. They really don't make them like this anymore. This is a Scorcese film so it is long but also worthy of your time. I felt if I hadn't read the book or was familiar with the story, some of it might have got lost on me which would have been a shame. However, because of reading the book, I already knew the context of the film so it might have been interesting going into it blind.",positive
346,I went into this movie not having read the book or fully watched the trailers. It was a captivating premise definitely worthy of a feature film and I enjoyed it but I would've liked to have it focus more heavily on the Osage people. The thing I was most interested in seeing when I went to the theater was a historical look at the Osage. This movie was more than I'd seen before but not nearly as much as it could have been. The narrative centered around Earnest when I think the more interesting perspective would've been Mollie. I found Earnest to be an interesting but not sympathetic character. The dynamic with his uncle was compelling but what I really wanted to see was how Mollie was feeling and thinking as members of her family and community were murdered around her.,positive
347,"The story in itself is interesting , even very interesting. The acting is good as expected , though not on the highest level.At some instances I thought this was a Paul Anderson movie. Some elements from Magnolia came along as well some elements from Zhang Yimou's Curse of the Golden Flower . Though honestly both of those movies are far superiour .The movie is too long and could have been edited to 2 hours .Not only that , the focus it too much on DiCaprio.We also get little insight on how the Osage are reacting on all this mess .I think this is a missed oportunity to tell a story seen from the eyes of the Osage themselves instead of this constant focus on Ernest.Scorcese has made better movies.",positive
348,"Lily Gladstone delivers a powerful performance as Mollie Kyle (later Burkhart), a Native American woman from the Osage tribe, whose family becomes the target of ruthless schemes driven by greed. The Osage County setting, particularly the small town of Pawhuska, is the backdrop for this chilling true story set in 1920s Oklahoma. The federal government had allocated the land to the Osage tribe during their forced relocation, and for years it was seen as undesirable-until oil was discovered beneath it. This sudden wealth attracted the attention of lower-class white settlers, eager to marry into the Osage families and gain control of their oil riches.Robert De Niro shines as William ""King"" Hale, a local figurehead who orchestrates these calculated marriages to dilute the Osage bloodline and seize their wealth. Hale arranges for his nephew, Ernest Burkhart (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), to marry Mollie Kyle, hoping to tighten his grip on the tribe's oil-rich assets.As wealth transforms the once-overlooked land into a coveted prize, the Osage tribe finds themselves under attack. Jealousy and greed lead to a series of unsolved murders, as the tribe's newfound fortune paints a target on their backs. The tension mounts when Mollie Burkhart's own family falls victim to these crimes, including the murder of her pregnant sister, Minnie Kyle. Determined to find answers, Mollie hires a private investigator, which ultimately leads to a federal investigation. This investigation marks the birth of what we now know as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), tasked with solving the murder spree that plagued Pawhuska.Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon not only captures the harrowing true events but also brings to light the systemic corruption and greed that fueled this tragic chapter of American history. The film masterfully weaves together themes of justice, betrayal, and the resilience of a people fighting for survival, offering a deeper understanding of the origins of the modern criminal justice system.",positive
349,"I know it is a true story but the ending relating to the fates of the monsters was so disappointing. They were like pure evil. Greed personified into cold, heartless human beings. It just feels like crap that they were let out eventually on parole or for good behavior, led normal lives until their deaths. Sadly, that's the world we live in. Truly, no one cares for the Osage. Also, I could have done without the true crime style show at the end which made it seem like we just watched a fictional story and it's all for entertainment.It's long just like The Irishman but still a great Scorsese show and a cinematic treat. So many great actors in this one. Enjoyed all the performances. It was educational for sure.",positive
350,"Overall the movie was great. It showed a really interesting part of American history and how it played out. However they were lots of points in the movie where it felt like it could have been shorter or edited down to make it more concise and keep it moving. Then once it got to the end of the movie it felt rushed, like the wraps up took only five minutes but it would have been interesting to see more of the characters in that wrap it. Like I said still overall a great movie. But the claims that it was the best works of all these top actors was a bit of
An over statement. It's worth the watch but don't feel bad if you need to get up and leave because when you come back you won't have missed anything.",positive
351,"I wasn't very convinced to watch it at first knowing the movie is 3.5 hours long. Especially when I wasn't a big fan of Martin Scorsese's recent work - The Irisman and Wolf of the Wall Street.However, Killer of the Flower Moon just far exceeded my expectation. Admittedly, it's really long, but the story is very well paced. All lines and scenes are necessary in either building the characters or developing the story. The film depicts a very disturbing and depressing part of history (how Osage people were brutally murdered) yet without any haste rushing straight to the point, the story unfolds slowly like a trickle of stream. Therefore, the sorrow I felt as I watched it was not a sharp one, but more like a crescendoing dull pain weighing on my chest, almost ignorable at first, and then before I realize, it became unbearably heavy. From the perspective of Mollies, I get to feel her extreme agony and powerlessness in losing her families one by one. It gives audiences the desire to read more about the history and think how this could have happened, which I think is the point of this film - that dark period taken place on native Americans should never be forgotten.That being said, I would recommend watching it at home on a comfy sofa so it can be properly enjoyed without constantly worrying about missing anything due to a toilet break.If I can have one complaint, it would be the leading actor, Leonardo. He is a good actor for sure, definitely having put efforts into understanding his role and how he should talk and behave. But I do feel certain fatigue watching him repeatedly pulling the same faces and acting in the same way in every films of his recent years. Can justify by saying he is just suitable for this sort of characters, yet it distracts audiences (maybe just me) a bit so would be good to have someone else to play this role.",positive
352,"As a long time admirer of Scorsese's work I was looking forward to seeing Killers of the Flower moon which promised to be a departure from some of his more common themes.I only knew a little about the subject matter but expected it to be more about some kind of institutional plot/conspiracy rather than what turned out to be the machinations of a small number of evil men,although the matter of the guardians and their control over Mollie and other defined ""incompetents""does signify a more governmental aspect.The subject matter is undeniably serious and amplified by a sombre tone throughout;the sound is subdued,the lighting dim,and the repetitious nature of the action all contribute to an unrelenting tone and the intimate extended focus on Mollie's situation can at times make the viewer feel in some way voyeuristic or complicit.I was impressed by Di Caprio's performance but was left unsure as to what extent he was willingly involved or was simply being used due to his limited intellect.His deterioration as the plot unfolds is impressive,his dialogue becoming increasingly more terse, echoing in some way the stoical Molly.On the other hand I found De Niro's performance surprisingly flat,lacking nuance and the latent menace we know he can portray,coming over as just a bully,rather than some Machiavellian manipulator.If you didn't know this was a true story you might doubt the credibility of going to so much trouble to deliver the protagonist's ends.I also thought it was too long to support the often repetitious events.However it was a powerful and challenging film,which is what you expect from a great film-maker but I was left with the feeling of something missing by the end and I suspect it would no doubt benefit from a second viewing.",positive
353,"This movie felt like it was there to tell you a story, not to entertain you... I heard critizicms that it was to long and/or moving too slow, and it definitely was, but i never thought after watching it, that it should have been faster paced or shorter... It wants to tell you a story, and the length of it contributes to immersing you in the story because it puts you in the shoes of the Osage, makes you feel like they must have felt, like bro... when is this stuff going to be finally resolved and come to a conclusion, why are we out here suffering and dying and it just wont stop and nothing is being done about it, so when the plot finally starts to thicken its such a relief... i never felt like this movie should entertain me, i felt immersed in the story and the characters and i definitely cursed at the screen a couple of times... what i didnt expect is how much i actually felt for the main character portrayed by Leo, who seems like somewhere in there hes got a conscience but he just has no GUTS to stand up for what he knows is right, and when he finally does it is way to late.... good movie.",positive
354,"I'm sorry this movie was tarnished by the excessive repetition and long pauses. This is an important story that needed to be told. The excessive unnecessary length & redundancy takes away from the message as it makes for a painfully long movie. You get what's happening within the first hour so there's an extra hour (at least) of eye-rolling filler that could be been cut.Movie makers need to understand the pain points of the viewers, those exact people they're trying to reach. We get what's happening from the start. It's obvious. We don't need it to be repeated and repeated and repeated what's going on. Even the dumbest person would comprehend it. And to watch this in the theater, bladders everywhere are suffering. There's no need for a 2-hour movie to be dragged out to 3.5 excruciating hours.Editing is an ignored skill here.I'm so sad this is based in a true story. Humanity can be so horrible.",positive
355,"Here in the West, so-called Whites are entitled and privileged to talk about how they won and solved the mysteries of the universe. The so-called colored or indigenous peoples are allowed to explain how they lost and were swallowed in the unfathomable void of their suffering so that we can feel their pain. This is the predictable pattern to ethnic strife presented in American Cinema, and this Martin Scorsese masterpiece while teasing at being morally innovative in its profundity, is ironically, at a budget of 200 million dollars, a product of the very power and privilege it seeks to expose and protest. The anti-life antics of Leonardo DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart and Robert DeNiro as William King Hale take center stage in this epic, but it is the great beauty and moral gravitas of Lily Gladstone as Mollie Kyle that anchors this tragedy and makes us willing to sit through more than three hours of what becomes a ghastly love and horror story. While boasting stirring and startling performances from the likes of Jesse Piemons as agent Thomas Bruce White Sr., Tantoo Cardinal as Lizzie Q, Mollie's mother as well as John Lithgow and Brendan Fraser as prosecuting and defending attorneys, this film, despite its undeniable Anglo-American perspective; is saturated with the collaboration of the Osage Nation and other Native American principals.While this particular production eventually grinds down into the rhythms I would normally associate with Shakespeare and performances of KING LEAR as helmed by Oliver and Schofield, this ambitious reach is not entirely unfitting or without merit. Once again, it is Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burhart who becomes the revelation here. Before us on the screen is a leading lady of Native American heritage whom the camera loves. She generates an emotive force that made me recall Olivia DeHavilland and Ingrid Bergman. While Native Americans more grounded either by experience or learning or expertise in a shared cultural experience, can rightly criticize and make salient points about the context of this murderous drama, or the arcs or backstory of some of the indigenous characters, the images of Mollie's descent into suffering are compelling and enduring.Scorsese lovingly exercises a visual and cinematic literacy that harkens back to the early days of silent movies, but as well references the tenebrism of Carvaggio and Rembrandt. This is particularly evident in the scenes where white servants are waiting hand and foot on these Natives who have been unexpectedly fortunate enough to accidentally strike black gold. The issue of assimilation is spectacularly and sensationally presented here in the relationship between Ernest and Mollie Burkhart. The love Mollie shows for her husband becomes all the more poignant as she gradually comes to realize he is in cahoots with William King Hale and slowly but surely is poisoning her to death. The fact that this does not deter her in doing all she can to end The Reign of Terror being visited upon her and the rest of the Osage citizens makes her love appear all the more heroic.There is much to the argument made by one reviewer that the story should have revolved and centered more on the character of Mollie Burkhart with a fuller and richer backstory. However, it cannot be denied that Ms. Gladstone makes the most of the opportunity given her by director Scorsese, and achieves moments comparable to and at times surpassing what Ingird Bergman did in GASLIGHT (1944) and NOTORIOUS (1948). That is heady stuff to say when you are bouncing lines off of and sharing scenes with renowned A-Listers like DeNiro and DiCaprio. But this actress more than holds her own and we look forward to her swinging from the heels and continuing to convey the Native American perspective in dramas as absorbing and unforgettable as THE HEIRESS (1949) and THE SNAKE PIT (1948) with DeHavilland as well as CASBLANCA (1942) and ANASTASIA (1954), which highlighted Bergman's acting prowess. Time to cross our fingers and hope Lily Gladstone will go on working her magic with the most able directors and in the midst of the most accomplished ensemble casts.As it stands, this is still a Western that will do to ride the river with. While admittedly you won't learn much about head rights or guardians or allotment; this didactic function of cinema being soft-pedaled here, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto makes this latest demythologizing of How the West Was Won elegiacally vivid. It is in this respect that Scorsese's latest offering shares such great affinity with Eastwood's revisionist Western UNFORGIVEN (1992).But isn't it interesting how Native Americans are still being presented as victims here in the twentyfirst century, while Western Man continues to exhort that there is much to be learned from Death? Perhaps so, and it may be that the importance of Death in the dealings and affairs of human beings is not to be underestimated. Eastern Man is not much better in his focus on self abnegation, but they are to be at least commended for being able to project a palpable vision of a paradise on Earth. But guess what? It would be great to have a Native American filmmaker breakthrough to capture the imagination of the viewing public with a startling original system of aesthetics owing to his cultural perspective and having pundits discussing how important his newest work is to the cultural consciousness of our times. I can assure you that these new Native American voices do exist. Such voices echo out of such unlikely places as NASA and the Aircrete tepees and domes being constructed by tribal leaders that bear such a striking resemblance to R. Buckminister Fuller's Dymaxion House. There may also be something to be learned from witnessing people sharing ideas and resources while somehow getting along with each other.Just a thought...",positive
356,"The true story narrated by ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is very interesting and it is treated pretty well by the movie screenplay. It is a story about greed mixed with racism, displaying how despicable the human genere can be. The movie investigates these themes pretty well since it is well crafted. The characters, which are the core of the film, are well characterized and magnificently played. From top to bottom all the cast was great, but DiCaprio and De Niro put a masterclass on screen and they were magnetic when placed in the scene. A mention has to be made also for Lily Gladstone that gave a lot of emotions to her character and she managed not to disfigure beside the previously mentioned holy monsters. The technical aspects of the movie were also solid, but sincerely I expected more by Scorsese in terms of direction. It's not bad and it is totally able to carry out the story in a solid way. However, there are no flashes or scenes that will remain iconic. For instance all the dialogues are camera on who is speaking, cut to the new one speaking, cut and go back to the other one and so on. What keeps the scenes always captivating are the acting performances because, as said above, especially DiCaprio and De Niro are so good that that they draw the viewer's full attention but in a positive way since they characters feel like real people.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" has however a major issue that compromises the overall judgment of the movie and it is the length combined with the pacing. Indeed it's not the fact that it lasts 3 hours and 20 minutes, but rather the pacing. The film is slow for the entire duration and that's where the problem lays. There aren't moments that accelerate the rhythm a bit to then go back to the slower pace giving to viewers a rollercoaster experience in terms of pacing. And I'm not talking about the events narrated, but rather the rhythm given by the editing, the direction and the dialogues. Reflecting on this aspect I also thought that maybe it was an intentional choice to give a sensation of inexorability. However, even if this is the case, it remains a critical defect. To give a true life experience two people around me fell asleep in the theatre. I really liked the movie but at a certain point I felt the length, unlike for Oppenheimer that was roughly of the same length but it featured various changes of rhythm.In conclusion I strongly suggest to watch ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" because it is a very good movie and because it tells a story that is worthy to be narrated to a large audience. It has however a big issue related to the length and the constant slow pace. Personally despite this I would still watch it again because it is very well made and interesting and it has a lot of things to be liked. And so this problem is not critical and can be overcome, but be aware of it. First of all by seeing this movie when you are not tired and then be prepared to eventually feel bored. Unfortunately there is the possibility.",positive
357,"This film was like Scorsese read a Wikipedia page of an event he thought would be an easy Oscar grab, told Leo to do a Corleone jawed southern drawl, then once they had 4 hours worth of closeups of Leo's face they forgot they were supposed to be telling a story about the Osage.I thought Lily Gladstone, Sturgill, and Jason Isbell were great. That was the only positive for me. There's an infinite amount of disjointed scene changes that add no value to the story. The only enjoyable character is played by Lily Gladstone and is sidelined for the whole film while Rob and Leo eat up 98% of the screen time playing bland, one dimensional, and remarkably uninteresting characters. Also, De Niro starts the movie with a different accent than he finishes it with? There was only one memorable scene I can think of in the entire four hours and half the theater was laughing because they didn't understand it was supposed to be a heavy scene. After three hours and twenty minutes of the story moving no further than what Leo and Rob's characters blatantly spelled out to the audience in their first interaction, I walked out. I will definitely just be reading the book of Scorsese's next plot because, wow, I am amazed at how he managed to make such an interesting piece of history so incredibly uninteresting.If I had to choose between watching Paul Blart on an endless loop for the rest of eternity or watching Killers of the Flower Moon just once, I would choose Paul Blart without hesitation. This movie is a terrible waste of time and money and everyone will forget it existed the second it's out of theaters.",positive
358,"A strong brooding film that gets better and better as it glides across the screen.A fantastic cast led by one of the great directors deliver a captivating story. It lacks the flamboyance of some similar films, no power speeches here, but keeps your full attention right to the closing credits.I can't sit here and justify the length of the movie, it probably didn't need to be this long, yet at the same time I wasn't sitting there wishing it would hurry up and finish.Beautifully shot with a set design that really captures the era, it is a great looking film.Not Scorsese's best but very enjoyable :)",positive
359,"Killers of the Flower Moon feels like Goodfellas had a baby with an old timey western. The distinct Scorsese trademarks are all here - quick murder shots, great music, beautiful visuals, and A+ acting from veteran actors. The Osage murders are also a story worth telling on the big screen, with Killers of the Flower Moon pulling no punches as it re-tells what happened when a bunch of men discovered how they can tap into the wealth of the Osage Indians.Unfortunately, the movie didn't rise to my high expectations. The 3.5-hour runtime should have been tightened up by 30 minutes and the pacing is too leisurely, much like The Irishman. There was some choppy editing and confusing cut-scenes inserted into the story as well.Overall, another solid movie from Scorsese that sees an improvement over The Irishman, although not quite reaching the heights of some of his earlier films. Powerful message in solidarity with the Osage too.",positive
360,"I've not heard of the Osage murders until I watched this movie. So, the starting was a bit confusing for me. The movie is set at a pace which I can't say is slow but it could be better if it was faster. The acting is good. But somehow the element of fear and mistrust within the tribe resulting from the unexplained murders was not projected in the movie. Corruption amongst local officials in covering up the murders was not shown in much detail too. Given the length of the movie which was around 3 hours, I expected the movie would show more murders involving more Osage families but the movie was focused on one particular family. But all in all, it was a worthwhile movie to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone carried their roles really well.",positive
361,"The period of the movie seems to be too long on the first act that told about how the two main actor met and how King's position on this city.

The scenery was good.I have many feeling watching this but I feel sorry to the Osage that have to meet the greedy people also the movie acclaim them are the hungry wolf, hyena , snake and the poison.Sometimes it feeling like the movie 'Parasite' and the God father.",positive
362,"Every actor delivers a superb performance. One or more will walk away with an Oscar. Acting is not my issue with the movie. I knew that this was a dark and depressing story going in with no real light at the end of the tunnel but one can only take so much doom and gloom. I didn't check the run time and I will never make that mistake again. I know Scorsese's intentions were good in wanting get the full effect of the horrific atrocities committed against the Osage, but I've seen documentaries on the subject that better held my attention. Three and a half hours is too long for any movie. This is 2023 and we're lucky if we can pay attention to anything more than an hour.",positive
363,"I cannot comprehend the thought processing that went into the conclusion of this film. I am somebody that would rarely write a review about a movie on IMDb unless my opinion was wildly different, and for the most part mine isn't, but the ending is unforgivable.First the good; The world building is immaculate, you feel like you could explain how everything in the town works even if you couldn't name specifics. The acting is phenomenal , and De Niro's menace, and Di Caprio's, well, earnestness shine through. The cinematography and the way everything looks feels visceral and real. The story keeps you hooked, even if it is long and ponderous.And I suppose, 100% this film is long. And it will leave many bored. But if you buy into the film, and feel intrigued by what you're essentially watching being a walkthrough of De Niro's Hale's control and degradation of a town and it's community you'll be hooked.Which is why the ending itself is such a betrayal.Because after sitting through 3 hours and 20 minutes, the ending , which has been building to a court case and sentencing for Hale, is reported over a radio play; with the person given the conclusion being Scorsese himself.It's incredibly self congratulatory, and to a point, feels hypocritical of Scorsese's virtue signalling against superhero films, after he betrayed the key tenet of cinema or 'show don't tell'.Maybe its because the real life story is so bleak so he felt no good way to end it, (Hale doesn't seem to really have much of a bad time), but that's still a story to tell. And could've been handled in an injustice style ending.But the way it was presenting was frankly just sad- it felt like no one had any idea how to end it after creating a masterpiece to that point.An absolute shame.",positive
364,"I waited to watch this movie so I could get around to reading the book. So much details missing from the movie. In the book there is an entire chapter dedicated to Tom White's life leading up to him joining the Bureau. Tom White was a hero in this story and understandably, and sadly, there's just not enough time in a single movie to go into these types of details.J Edgar Hoover was also involved, of course, because he was leading the Bureau. Hoover's barely mentioned in the movie. Hoover wanted the cases solved in a way that wouldn't embarrass the Bureau and at times Tom Whites career was in jeopardy, and so was Hoover's.Hale and associates involvement was only the tip of the iceberg. 100's of Osage most likely were murdered for there headrights. Some white people handling full blooded Osages income were robbing their wards blind of millions. Hale was probably the most egregious out of all the white people stealing from the Osage but he was not the only one. All this is in the book but missing from the movie.The above text isn't the only details missing from the movie. So I urge anyone who wants the full story, as much as David Grann was able to uncover, to read the book.",positive
365,"Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plain! (remember?). But the Oklahoma here is depicted first and foremost as oil-rich country, with an opening scene of oil gushing ferociously from the ground, delighting the gathered local people into a state of frenzy.As broad brush background, a few black-and-while stills follow with captions such as ""The Osage Nation"", ""chosen people"", ""richest people per capita on earth"". Without wasting time, this macro backdrop is complemented with micro details: a conversation. WWI veteran Ernest (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to work with cattle rancher Uncle William (Robert De Niro), otherwise known as ""King"". The lofty title reflects not blunt force but rather superb interpersonal skills that wins him the friendship and trust of both Whites and Natives in Osage country. More precisely, this philanthropic outsider is more like a kingmaker in the Osage region. Essential details emerge from this cordial uncle-nephew chat. ""The Osage people are kindly people, big-hearted people, but sickly (a very important detail)"". ""I was a cook in the infantry"". ""You fed the soldiers, they won the war"". ""Money flows freely here. You like woman?"" ""You like Red?""Under the disarming, congenial persona of the uncle, the plot thickens. Ernest is immediately marked as a useful pawn in scheming for the fortune of the oil-rich tribe, or oil-royalty-rich, more precisely. An ugly, bloody chapter in history is presented by auteur Scorsese in this 206-minute epic: the Osage murders in the 1920s.The first hour of this 3.5 hour epic takes us through a courtship, a wedding, to a landmark point of a key murder. Uncle's sinister motivation notwithstanding, the romance between nephew and wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) blossoms with genuine mutual affection, with him starting as her chauffer-for-hire an ending up winning her heart, making her laugh with his easy, earthy style. The murder victim is Minnie, one of Mollie's invalid sisters whose share of the rich oil estate goes to their mother Lizzie Q (Tantoo Cardinal).The next hour meanders through an assortment of minor characters and a series of murders, with victims blown up, shot or die in suspicious-looking ailments. It is at once convoluted and simple, convoluted in details of the matrix of succession of the wealth, and simple in the ultimate intentions of white coveting the oil wealth of native play, playing ""the long game"", for Ernest to eventually gain the headrights of Mollie's family, after they are eliminated one-by-one.The final hour moves into FBI procedure and courtroom battle territory. Three pedigree actors appear. Playing FBI investigator is Jesse Plemons (The Power of the Dog, Game Night, Fargo - season 2). Facing off are two lawyers portrayed by John Lithgow (magna-veteran with 132 entries in IMDb but probably best remembered recently as Churchill in TV series The Crown) and Brendan Fraser (gain popularity from crowd-pleasing ""Mummy"" franchise; earned respect with Oscar-winning ""The Whale"").One quote in this movie from a book provides best insight to ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" - ""Do you see the wolves in this picture?"" The question is almost rhetorical as the wolves are operating in plain sight, and the worst kind that would stop at nothing, however evil, for greed.While the aforementioned supports are excellent, this movie pivots on the tripod of leads. Scorsese's two favourite were in a movie together only once before, 3 decades ago, ""This Boy's Life"" (not directed by him). Gladstone matches these two heavyweights scene for scene, and I won't be surprised that all three get nomination to lead acting awards in the upcoming Oscar.",positive

There were about 60 Indians-and a few whites-that were murdered. It's directed by Martin Scorsese and has a stellar cast but it is a little long at 3 & 1/2 hours, so make sure that you visit the restroom before the movie starts. Leo plays a veteran of the military-he was a cook-that returns to Oklahoma to work for his uncle, Robert. The town is mostly Osage Indians, who hit oil on their land and are now very wealthy. Robert is a deputy policeman that pretty much runs the town and has his own plans for the Indian's money. Lily is a native Osage woman that Leo falls for and marries. Most of the Indian women have married white man and not all of the men are in it for love. After so many of the Indian women turn up dead and local law enforcement hasn't done anything about it, Lily goes to the F. B. I. And Jesse plays the agent they send to investigate. John is the prosecutor and Brendan is the defense lawyer that try the guilty people near the end. At the end of the movie-when they usually have statements on screen about what happened to certain people-they do something a little different.It's rated R for violence, grisly images and language and has a running time of 3 hours & 26 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be alright to stream.",positive

Leonardo di Caprio had the whole film about a facial expression that reminded me of Gollum. I found his performance set up, unnatural and much too artificial. The trailer contains all the action sequences of the film, some of which are only incidental to the film. The film had a completely different effect on me than the trailer, lengthy and not focused on the essentials. At the end there is an American puppet theatre, where Martin Scorse himself appears instructively with a message that would not have been necessary.",positive

The brutal story of how White people killed wealthy Native American tribespeople, the Osage, who controlled lands with oil. Ernest, working with his conniving uncle King, work to deceive and kill the Osage people to gain control of money, land, and oil.RATINGC+While this is a competently made film, and the filmmaking itself is good, jam-packed with gorgeous visuals and performances, the underlying content of this film is surprisingly despicable. This entire story is from the perspective of White people, and though they are supposedly the focus, the Osage people are thin, minor, shallow characters - essentially and always, a victim. At the end of the film - which bizarrely ends with a ""radio show"" being done ""years from now"" that dramatize the events (is this some self-critical denouncement of the film itself?) - the White people don't even get their comeuppance. It's a White savior story without a savior.",positive

By this I'm mostly talking about all of Ernest and Mollie's relationship. They meet and fall in love in the first few minutes of the film. Then they've suddenly got two kids with no indication of much time passing at all.Also... there's a few plot twists / plot reveals which happen at the end of the film which were so noticeable and obvious to figure out I was beyond surprised when they actually spelled it out.Aside from all that, really enjoyed it.

372,"Like others have stated this is a long film. A very long film. As in Lord of the Rings long. But unlike Lord of the Rings it isn't much of an adventure, none of the characters are particularly interesting, and, for the most part, the story isn't too exciting.It is, however, very well-written, well-acted and well-shot. The setting, the d√©cor, the hairstyles, the outfits, etc. All looked timely and authentic which helps to immerse one in the story. But other than that I didn't feel overly involved or invested in the story or it's characters. I think it would have made for a compelling documentary to watch at home but it lacked the necessary components of a blockbuster film. I think a big issue with the film is that it lacks payoff, we have antagonists, and we have victims, but we don't really have a protagonist, someone to root for. Justice is served eventually and the investigators who crack the case actually seem like the kind of characters who I could have attached myself to for the duration, but instead we get about half an hours screen time with them, and even then that part of the story seems very rushed.Overall an interesting insight into a particular time, place and event but as far as storytelling it wasn't overly captivating.",positive
373,"With this being one of my anticipated movies of 2023, I wasn't disappointed.Martin Scorsese is a filmmaker I enjoy watching as Scorsese has made many amazing movies in his career with ""Taxi Driver, Silence, The Last Temptation of Christ, After Hours, Raging Bull and Bringing Out the Dead'' being my personal favorites from him. With this new movie, Scorsese continues to achieve strong directing and style as his direction was great on handling the movie's tone, energy and structure. Throughout, the production, costumes, make-up, and the setting was really good as it helped capture the western period of the 1920s. The camerawork was beautiful with some beautiful landscapes and shot compositions throughout. The writing is great as the narrative written by Scorsese and Eric Roth were able to explore many themes of corruption, racism, and exploitation between the characters and setting that were quite intense and engaging to observe throughout.Every performance was amazing as DiCaprio and De Niro are both awesome. Lily Gladstone was absolutely stellar as gave an outstanding performance and I am happy to see her get to work in more projects after seeing her in ""Certain Woman"". Alongside with every single cast member as well. The characters were well-written and each character felt realistic with the personalities, emotions and traits provided amongst them. The musical score was amazing, the dialogue was really good, and the pacing is pretty good. My only issue with the movie there was a few small pacing issues at some points.Overall, Scorsese strikes again and it was an amazing epic movie.",positive

I have heard nothing about it because I wanted to be interested because I liked the director and I certainly got what I wanted.I really enjoyed the main character seeing him spiral around not having a spine so almost every personal talk to him can control him.It was just nice seeing a Martin's got saisi film who didn't feel too long I watched the Irish man and that film is almost tortured but how long it feels this one didn't feel as long it fels like two and a half hours instead of 3:16.,positive
375,"I think his acting stinks. This has changed my mind.This isn't much of a traditional movie as much as it's an indictment on the casual development of a town that integrated indigenous people yet treated them like second class citizen. Though some people may think that this is a pity party for the Osage people who were first pushed off their land, THEN soft murdered to gain access to oil money. This is more about greed. Mostly accusing the Caucasian settlers of taking advantage of these situations. All drawn from facts.Ernest Burkhardt (Dicaprio) is a man who just returned from WW1. Settling in with his uncle William Hale (Robert DeNiro) who likes and wants to be called ""King"" Much like the movie ""Giant"" cattle seemed to be the major money maker. However, when oil struck, cattle seemed to be sidelined. It is a also about envy. Hale is a man, who passively runs the town. His manipulation is sociopathic. Always looking for the greater good but using the worst tactics. He has learned the language of the Osage. Integrated NOT for building a community but to draw class lines within. Deep down, DeNiro plays Hale as a man who still considers Brown/Red people beneath him but pretends not to. This is his conflict. His eyes are to get land from the Osage through a loophole where the White people can gain the land rights by marriage. Through very devious manipulation. This runs conflict with Ernest new love interest Mollie (the wonderful Lily Gladstone)Both Hale and Ernest run different schemes. Ernest less polished. The Whites in this are portrayed as conniving criminals and cockroaches. Whilst the Osage community is seen as rich culturally. With the exception of Anna, who is Mollie's sister. She is a rambunctious drunk who has taken to the White style of living.But I digress. Because of these mysterious deaths (the worse being that of doctors being involved in poisoning) the Feds are called in. Which is the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.A lot of times I desperately wanted it to be the crack ending that something like ""Mississippi Burning"" had. Where the perpetrators of the crime get their comeuppance, yet with a twinge of sadness that they didn't get the maximum they deserve. Other times I thought it being odd they ended it on some stage play re-enactment for Lucky Strike brand cigarettes. Though I found myself also skeptical that all Osage people could be good, poetic and one with nature. And all White people are scum, this only presents itself in the here and now.Director Martin Scorsese fills the screen with faces and landscape. A genius at giving empathy to terrible people. This is an epic tale of a lost person who was tasked to do one thing and had to search deep to realize how someone else's ambition drove him to nearly unspeakable act.This is one to study later on.",positive

The amazing story rambles on, and on, and on, and you're sitting there thinking we're going to need a conclusion at some point and then... after three hours... it cuts to a Broadway theatre and concludes the ending in three minutes as if we've been watching a play the whole time... Disappointing ending to say the least. Please Mr Scorsese can you finish your film off properly in a timely fashion? One hour less with a proper conclusion to the court scene letting us know that all the baddies got locked up for a longtime would have been good. Enjoyed it though.",positive
377,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" (2023) in my opinion, is one of Martin Scorsese's most calm movies. And by calm i mean its not pulsating with energy like it was in a movies ""Departed"", ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", or Goodfellas"". In ""Killers"" he used different approach and pacing. This is a more absorbing, character driven movie about place, time and situation. Haven't been heard about things this movie was based on, i was captivated in this film for all 3 hours 30 min. This is one of the very best films of the year.Leonardo DiCaprio in my opinion gave one of the very best performances in his carrier. There is a person who is likable, yet at the end i routed against him. Robert De Niro was also superb as well as Lily Gladstone. And yet again i can only say that the biggest start of ""Killers"" is Martin Scorsese. Here is 3 h 30 min movie, slowly paced, but structured so superbly that it wasn't boring for a minute. Honestly i couldn't cut a minute from it.Overall, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is easily one of the very best movie I've seen in 2023 - might be the best. Don't get long run time scare you - film is extremely well paced, directed and written and acting is more then amazing. Superb film in every way.",positive
378,"When I first heard this movie crested the three and a half hour mark, I was not phased, but excited. The Lord of the Rings, Schindler's List, Oppenheimer, these are some of my favorite films and all of them had one thing Killers of Flower moon didn't: my undivided attention. Unfortunately this one fell short.KOFM starts out strong with interesting visuals, strong world building, and promising characters(the latter less so as the film goes on). As we get deeper into the story, we meet all of our main players and pretty much right off the bat, we understand who they are supposed to be. De Niro a deprived, evil man masquerading as a friend and confidant to the Osage. Leo, his bumbling henchman so consumed in his own avarice he is almost unaware of the atrocities he has taken part in. The lovely Gladstone as his long suffering wife, the hapless Osage victims. And De Niro's band of merry evil men. Again, a very strong prologue to a powerful story. Where the story seems to lose me isn't necessarily with the pacing, every scene was where it should be, although a few ran just a bit too long and became just a bit too repetitive. Unfortunately it lost me with the very thing that got me invested in the first place, it's characters. Everyone(mostly)seemed very one dimensional. De Niro was almost mustache twistingly evil, so obviously the mastermind behind the mystery I don't know why they framed it as a mystery at all. I also really want to understand Leo's character. I think I expected more of a man so conflicted by family, greed, duty, and love that he goes insane trying to figure out where to draw those lines in his mind. Instead we get a half of the time man child who happens to have absolutely no problem with straight out murder for money and half the time loving and capable husband and father. No inner conflict. No guilt. No breaking sense of reality. Maybe I just expected too much, or maybe I am watching the wrong movie. The only stand out character was Gladstone's. She was refined, strong willed and held a very powerful on screen presence. But the. They did something again, I didn't not expect to make sense. They sidelined her for the entire investigation, and brought her back only as a comfort to Leo's character. Honestly by the end of the movie the only character motivation that made sense was ""evil men want money"". I could go on for paragraphs about how lackluster this collection of characters are but, I don't want to ramble.All of that being said, the acting was as to be expected for this caliber of the group. It was above average to outstanding. Gladstone was obviously outstanding. De Niro played a guy he's played before albeit very well. And Leo, well, he was also good. He just didn't have enough to work with to really put this performance up there with some of his greatest works. There also were some very delightful performances by some of the supporting cast.My point is the acting was good. The cinematography was good. The costumes were good. It was an objectively good movie. It's not too long, it only drags a little, and it's characters are lacking something. I gave it a 6, but the third act, some good humor and Gladstone's performance bumped it up to a 7.I will be watching it again when it comes out on streaming to see if i am able to feel anything else.",positive
379,"Let me start out by saying there are some very impressive performances here. As expected Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro are terrific, they almost always are. But in truth, the best performance is by Lily Gladstone. She should (and hopefully will) get an Academy Award nomination. The supporting cast is also excellent, it's overall a terrific film to see for acting performances. I had read the book, so I was aware of the plot. It may be a little dificult for some people to follow if you haven't. But I can't get away from the elephant in the room, namely the length (around three and a half hours). Somehow (I'm not sure how since I have prostate issues) I managed to sit through this without taking a bathroom break. I also didn't fall asleep although I did have to catch myself a few times and others in the theater did nod off. It is just wrong to have a running time this long with no intermission. Because I was hearing this might be Scorsese's last film and I personally still prefer to see films in a theater, I saw this at one. At home I could have paused this to take a few breaks. And I wouldn't have had to put up with trying to hold my bladder or having a very sore back from sitting that long in a theater seat without getting up to move around. And let's be honest, there isn't enough going on that the movie couldn't have been cut by an hour or so with some better editing. Scorsese has forgotten the moviegoers and failed to show them the respect they (the people who foot the bill for his movies) deserve by not either doing a better editing job, having an intermission, or what should have been done, doing both.",positive
380,"In 1919 rustic WWI veteran DiCaprio returns from battle to live with (and seek work) from influential uncle De Niro on his ranch in Oklahoma, located right in the vicinity of the Osage Nation who've discovered oil and slowly assimilated themselves into white society. DiCaprio gets in the good graces of (and eventually weds) Osage spinster Gladstone and initially all seems well, but then waves of violence and slaughter commence against the Osage which eventually forces the BOI to intervene. A real-life series of Western crime incidents are given the epic-scale treatment which makes for a long slog, but the story is riveting, emotions are raw and real, the cinematography outstanding, and the actors are fully invested. Even with their numerous collaborations with the director in the past, this is actually the first onscreen pairing of DiCaprio and De Niro with Scorsese behind the camera, and no big surprise that they deliver the goods, but the true revelation is Gladstone in a quietly captivating performance. ***",positive
381,"Amazing film. It was filled with amazing acting by DiCaprio and DeNero. The 3.5 hours was a chore to sit through so be prepared for the long haul. I feel like I really felt the emotions throughout the entirety. It really hit me seeing DiCaprio's character, a slow minded but well meaning man, being so corrupted by the greed and evil of this time. You really get the sense that he loves his wife and his family. The last hour of the film is quite the character study and is worth waiting for.Also, check the date on this review and know that I call Lily Gladstone winning the Oscar this year. You've heard it here first folks.",positive
382,The teaser had me hook from the start and really proved that cinema was back. Well paced film felt more like two hours and things that were mentioned earlier returned later on in the film. Without spoiling the film the ending felt like martys last while paying respect to the fallen osage of the 1920s. This movie was worth the hype and loved every minute of it. The movie theater i saw it at was at galaxy in riverside and it was an amazing experince too bad i spent like 42 dollars there. Anyways this film will grip you and may have you tear up at the end and yes there is some gory imagery but this is a crime film.,positive
383,"The movie is about a protagonist that keeps making bad decision after bad decision. It's a morose story about Indians being killed for their oil money, and the main character getting involved in this scheme without any hesitation or questions, even though he married one the Indians. It's hard to feel any tension or excitement (or anything but sadness) because you can't relate to the main character. They just do awful things to innocent people without any justified motivation, only because they're told so. It's a very long movie about a very passive character, who in the end gets more than he deserves. If DiCaprio, DeNiro and Scorsese were not involved in this picture, this would not get the attention or hype it got.",positive
384,"Almost 3 and 1/2 hours went by so fast! For Leonardo Dicaprio the performance of his career. Will be an Oscar nomination if not winner. Same for Robert DeNiro and Jesse Plemmons. While performance was just a few minutes, both John Lithgow and Brendan Fraser gave incredible depth to their roles. I have to say that the acting is what makes this film so amazing. Scorsese's framing device at the ending was the perfect coda, and a surprise to see the director himself in that scene! Was that a small tear I saw in his eye when he concluded the read? I have to admit that I was not aware that this story actually happened? Awards and or noms will go to all 5 actors mentioned above, plus writing, directing and best picture and more !!",positive
385,"What i really liked abt the film was its lenght. If a film is 2,5hrs or longer it becomes an experience, the story telling gets better, its like sour dough that gets a chance breath.The story is compelling and as someone who thinks robert deniro is overrated most of the times he really gave a wonderful performance. But its not a groundbreaking performance and many other actors couldve played the part well. I didnt like leo di caprios performance and i dont understand the hype around lily gladstone . She gives a good performance but her character is so passive and i just wish she had something more to work on. The same for leos performance, he seemed like a caricature in many scenes.In my opinion Cara Jade Myers was the highlight of the film as the troubled sister of molly. She really lit up the screen and the character + performance were top tier.To summarize: a good movie, good performances, characteres were a bit underdeveloped but its worth watching.",positive
386,"Killers of the Flower Moon has put me in one of the most delightful quandaries of my cinematic life. Let me be perfectly clear, Killers of the Flower Moon absolutely towers over thousands of movies you've seen this year. This is a thrilling, exhilarating, gorgeous and horrifying work of art from the master of cinema himself, Martin Scorsese. For 3 and 1/2 hours, you are glued to screen and completely untethered from reality. It tells both a grisly true crime story, more terrifying to witness than it is to read about and a heartbreaking tragedy of injustice and greed at its most grotesque. Both stories are absolutely worth your time in experiencing and I'd recommend seeing this film, in its behemoth-sized entirety, in a theater. But do both stories work as a complete, singular film? Is the whole greater than the sum of its parts? Or are the parts so good, they'd work better on their own? That is the question of the day.The Osage Nation, in northern Oklahoma, are a tribe blessed by an unspeakable bounty of oil underneath their feet. The twenties come roaring in for them, as the Osage becomes the wealthiest tribe in all of North America. But white would-be robber barons come gushing by the trainloads, and they want in on all of that oil money. Enter, Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), a down-on-his-luck, simple-minded WWI vet and the nephew of influential cattle rancher William ""King"" Hale (Robert DeNiro). Hale takes his nephew under his wing and influences him to marry a Osage woman in order to take control of the family head-rights. Ernest finds that woman in Mollie (Lily Gladstone). Mollie falls for him, despite being seemingly aware of his intentions of which she clearly resents. All is hunky dory until, out of nowhere, a mysterious rash of brutal killings take hold of the Osage nation. Bodies start piling up, one by one. Incidentally, Mollie's immediate family is directly impacted by the murders. She loses her sister Anna, and then her sister Rita. Mollie knows that someone close to her is wiping out her family for the head-rights. What she doesn't realize is that William Hale is running a diabolical criminal enterprise in killing Osage men and women. Furthermore, Ernest is directly involved in the planning of these murders and is plotting to take out his own wife by lacing her insulin with alcohol. Does Ernest care? Not really. ""I love money more than my own wife!"" he exclaims to his crony friends. Mollie solicits the help of the federal government and soon enough, a budding, early stage FBI comes knocking on Ernest's door.Ernest, Mollie and William are as richly developed and fascinating as any character we've seen in any Martin Scorsese picture. Ernest is guided merely by his primal desires for sex and greed. He has no depth, integrity or any self-respect. Like most of Scorsese's male protagonists, Ernest's lack of morals motivate every bad decision he makes and we the viewer watch in awe at how badly he debases himself in pursuits of his goals. William Hale, portrayed by Robert DeNiro, is one of the most evil screen villains I've seen in recent memory and easily the worst person DeNiro has ever played on screen. He's a master manipulator and a methodical psychopath, who befriends the Osage nation as a loyal benefactor and an ally, with every intention of wiping out their wealth, their land and their lives. This is a level of evil that most films never touch upon. The wolf in sheep's clothing. Lily Gladstone is absolutely mesmerizing as Mollie. She gives a profoundly beautiful performance as a woman utterly exhausted from the constant outrage and tragedy in her life. Her performance is a Best Actress Oscar contender for sure.So what is the thing that's confusing me so much? Honestly, it's the constant tonal shifts. Its stark to say the very least. It's an amazing gangster movie and it's an amazing tragedy. Marty goes back and forth between the two. That didn't completely sit well with me. Scorsese admitted weeks ago that he originally wrote the film through the perspective of the FBI agents and nearly forgot about the perspectives of the Osage nation. He did a substantial rewrite. Watching the film, you can really see it. It explains the bloated run-time. Some have suggested that the film could've been near perfect with a proper edit. The problem is, functionally, you'd lose so much if you did. Could Killers have benefited from being separated into two parts (Ala the Godfather)? Or sliced up into 30 minute episodes for a miniseries? It's an interesting thought. We'll never know for sure.",positive
387,"Good story, but pretty boring and drawn out like The Irishman. It was nice being able to sit through a movie peacefully but literally like no suspense, no build up, very little mystery, no twists or surprises, mediocre dialogue, the picture was great, they nailed it on capturing the era and unique characters. It was a breath of fresh air seeing something Rated R that wasn't overly sexualized. I love how they captured so well the two different sides of Decaprio's character, a loving/devoted husband who is (spoiler alert) simultaneously poisoning his wife and playing a part in murdering all her family members, shining a light on the dual nature of man. I also love how his wife has almost an aura of forgiveness and unconditional love after coming to find out what he has done, also showing the humanity and compassion a person can be capable of after such a deep betrayal.. Anyways, I'd give it 6.5 stars if I could, wouldn't feel right giving it 6. So here's a 7.",positive
388,"For his tenth film with Robert De Niro and his sixth film with Leonardo Di Caprio, Martin Scorsese made a large-scale adaptation of David Grann's 2017 novel 'Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI'.Martin Scorsese and Erich Roth wrote the screenplay for this cinematic tribute to the victims of a corrupt local clan leader, who decimated an Osage Indian community to steal their land when oil was discovered there in 1920s Oklahoma.If the duration - almost 4 hours - is not unanimously praised, the meticulous and passionate anthropological work, as well as the remarkable performances of Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone enthused movie buffs.An essential introspective film, which will get people talking at the 96th Academy Awards ceremony. Because 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is to Martin Scorsese what 'Dances with Wolves' (1990) is to Kevin Costner and 'Little Big Man' (1970) is to Arthur Penn.",positive
389,"This film isn't bad... but it might win the Oscar for 'longest time taken before anything interesting happens'For a 3 and a half hour movie with an incredible rating on IMDB I was expecting a masterpiece. I got a good move which, if Apple had made into a 4 episode mini series, everyone would have stopped watching after episode 2.It's a tragic story which deserved to be told with more vigour. The editing didn't do the events justice. I wanted to rewind a couple of scenes because I didn't catch the faces of the perpetrators twice. And in another part I thought we had moved forward in time but then I realised we had to be on the same day. The editing was all over the place. (for me at least).Saying that it's a decent film but probably not even in my top 10 Scorsese movies.As far as acting, Dicaprio seemed to put on this frown and down turned mouth expression way too much, and De Niro was what you expect. I actually thought Lily Gladstone was fantastic and so understated as Molly. She carried her scenes and I hope to see more of her in the future.I'm happy that I got a cut price cinema ticket to see this on the big screen but to be honest I think if you have an Apple TV subscription then you may as well wait for it to come out on that format because as long as you have a decent TV then you won't miss anything... and you'll appreciate a bathroom break, and the rewind button! 6.5/10 rounded up.",positive
390,"Genuinely shocked with how bad this movie was with such great actors and amazing director. Every single scene in the movie was shown for way too long with no suspense or thrill portrayed. Acting was good yes but what do you expect when you have a line up like that cast. I went into this movie with no knowledge about what was going to happen however I was well able to figure out every single thing that would come next, meaning there was nothing to catch my attention and try and figure out what was going to happen next. Honestly one of the worst movies I've ever watched and would highly recommend not going to see it. The high review status on this movie is disgraceful as this is not only my opinion, 5 people left during the movie at the cinema I attended.",positive
391,"'Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)' is a movie about the atrocities committed by white Americans on the Osage tribe. It takes place in Oklahoma; beginning from the 1920's and follows the story of Ernest and Molly Burkhart till they got divorced.During the 1920's, Oklahoma was majorly where the Osage community (a Native American tribe) lived. They had been dispatched over there by the US government because they thought that the land was barren. But it was soon found out that the land held an ocean of oil (black gold) underneath. The Osage claimed this oil and became the wealthiest independent community (per-capita) of that time.The plot follows Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he returns from WWI and is taken under the wing by his uncle, William Hale (Robert DeNiro). They live in Oklahoma with the Osage. William Hale is the rich, white, philanthropist, father figure to the Osage community. That is, only on the outside. Unknown to all of them, William Hale is actually the mastermind of a raging plot to acquire all the wealth from the Osage for the white Americans. His plan is cold and simple: make young white men marry the Osage women, kill the Osage women, inherit the land for yourself. He makes his nephew, Ernest, marry one of the reputed Osage women called Molly Kyle (Lily Gladstone). But Ernest truly falls in love with his wife. From there on, the movie follows how the corrupt father figure uses his nephew as a puppet to carry out a lot of murders (of Molly's sisters and other Osage) until finally an investigator from the Bureau of Investigation comes along to 'see about the murders'.Martin Scorsese's dedication is clearly visible, not just to the art of cinema, but also to bring the lost story of the Osage community to light. The movie spans three and a half hours long, but you won't even realize how fast the time goes.This was the first time I was watching Leonardo DiCaprio (who happens to be my favorite actor of all time), Robert DeNiro and Martin Scorsese on the big screen. I have seen a lot of movies by all three but I felt like I rediscovered their sheer brilliance because of the big screen.The acting in this movie is obviously incredible. This was also the first time I got to see Lily Gladstone's work, and let me just say that she actually might win this year's Academy Award. Leo DiCaprio brilliantly embodies the dilemma of the not-so-smart Ernest: whether to obey his uncle and continue with his greed, or whether to stay devoted to his wife. This kind of a mental dilemma can take a huge toll on anybody, especially somebody who isn't that smart. DiCaprio (as always) has reached this crux of his character and has done an exceptional job. Robert DeNiro is simultaneously menacing and powerful as the corrupt father figure.One of the main reasons this movie doesn't feel like a drag even though it's three and a half hours long is the production design - it completely immerses you and makes you feel like you're actually in 1920's Oklahoma. Also, the cinematography and soundtrack deserve special shout-outs.The direction of the movie is impeccable. Let me give you an example of Scorsese's genius:
Over time, Ernest Burkhart's dilemma starts to get the better of him and his wife, Molly, begins to realize who is actually behind the murders. So essentially, up till a point, Molly has been kept in the dark by Ernest, and slowly, she starts illuminating herself. This is highlighted by the placements of lamps, candles or other sources of light around the two characters at key moments. At the beginning, when Ernest is seducing Mollie while having dinner at her house, there is a bright headlamp just behind Ernest. But there is no source of light behind Molly: she's kept in the dark by him. Then there's one scene when she begins to suspect Ernest. During that time, a well-lit light is placed behind Ernest while a comparatively ill-lit candle is placed behind Mollie: she has slowly begun to catch up to her husband. And when she finally does figure it out, both of them have bright headlamps behind them in the scene: she isn't in the dark anymore.The title itself has a great subtext: the 'Flower Moon' basically stands for the Osage community and its 'Killers' are their own family. Hence - 'Killers of the Flower Moon'.This movie was enough to convince a teenager from the other side of the world that the white Americans did a great injustice on the Osage community. A kid who had no knowledge and technically nothing to do with this Native American tribe actually felt a deep sense of anger towards these oppressors. Such is the power of this movie, and I would recommend it to everyone who wants to actually watch good movies.",positive
392,"Based on David Grann's book, killers Of The Flower Moon captures a tragic history of systematic murder of the Osage people for their oil wealth. Scorsese vividly captures the themes of greed, exploitation and power play in this chilling non fiction story. He also unapologetically displays the culture of the Osage people in their dress, music, funeral and superstitious beliefs. One does not only appreciate the level of callousness and deceitfulness demonstrated by these greedy ""wolves"" but one is also sucked into the culture and life of the Osage people in a way you could imagine it when reading the book. As far as the 3 leading characters are concerned, Leonardo DiCaprio's character as Ernest Burkhart was played to perfection. He was servant in the US army infantry division and came to live with and work for his uncle. However, his inability to reflect deeply on the consequences of orders given to him by his uncle made him a tool that was used in perpetrating the heinous crimes committed by his uncle in order to have the headrights to his wife's family oil wealth. He was also a morally conflicted man who in a way tried to convince and deceive himself that he was doing the right thing by obeying his uncle's orders. Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart was the soul of this story. She symbolizes the irreversible physical and emotional damage the genocide had on families. Her subtle, soulful, haunting and emotionally alluring portrayal of Mollie Burkhart was an outstanding achievement and one for the ages. This is a movie that gets better with each watch and its only when considerable time has passed before cinephiles and film critics will realize how truly outstanding this movie is.",positive
393,"Easily the best movie I have watched in this year, the directorial genius and some great acting performances together stitch up this movie to go down in history as one of the greatest. The plot has been set great and the background score is right on point. The movie might seem too long, but every inch of it is relevant for the story and has been beautifully executed. The little detailing in the movie are so nice, from showing the era of that time, to the costumes, and time appropriation. Coming to the performance, no one is weak, none at all, even the side characters played it so well. Leo has been a heartthrob and our old little goose De Niro shows his class in their performances. I wish it got more traction among movie enthusiasts because it is a movie to be seen this year. The length might makes you a bit hesitant but every part of it is worth it, Recommended.",positive
394,"This movie tells a very sad story. It's shot beautifully, but it's really slow and long. The writing, directing is quite good, while the acting is amazing, especially from Lily Gladstone, but there were no relatable characters, everybody wanted the land, the oil and the money. This is based on a true story, so it's not the fault of the writing, but I need one character that I can root for. The cinematography and visual effects make this movie look really good, but it could have used much more editing. This movie is way too long. It's really slow too and this a very bad combo. This movie is good, but far from perfect.",positive
395,"Hey let's not kid anybody, it's a Osage Indian Goodfellas...that's exactly what it is. Only this time it's the Masonic Mafia killing Native Indians...and yes just like Goodfellas it's based on fact. It is shocking but no more so than other facts that have come to light. Yes it's excellent but I don't think it needed to be so long. That seems to be the trend of Scorsese's movies at the moment. DeCaprio and DeNiro do a fatastic job and transport you into the 1800's. It's allegedly about the formation of the FBI but this is the latter half of the story. And that is all I want to say. It's interesting if not very disturbing and I can see modern day society doing the same atrocities.",positive
396,"Where Oppenheimer was technically brilliant but was a story everyone should pretty well already know, Flower Moon wants to tell a story that most people probably don't know about. But its kryptonite, instead, is simply the framing of the story. A story about murdered women that has really few lines for the women. But beyond that, if you think about how this could immediately be more gripping and interesting, the frame of it being simply told by Mollie would do that.There is no thought about how it affected the community or the history of the FBI either. It is myopic to just two men, for the most part. It does show them for what they are and it's a story worth knowing. It is also a story much larger than just the killers, which is completely lost. The fascination with true crime sequence at the end does seem to divulge its own biases. And I'm sure the book dictated the scope. But it could have been so much better, so easily.As is, as with Oppenheimer, it's a good film, it just didn't really resonate beyond the technical prowess and the aspects of the story I wasn't aware of.",positive
397,"IN A NUTSHELL:
They had me at Martin Scorsese. His directing is fantastic but that's not news. He also worked as a screenwriter and producer on the film. He said that he knew he wanted to make the story into a movie as he was reading the book ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" by David Grann. He spent hours with Chief Standing Bear of the Osage Nation to grant permission to film it. About the movie, Scorsese said, ""It's not a whodunnit. It's a who-didn't-do-it.""
The screenplay was written by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese. I'm sure we'll see this nominated for Best Picture.THINGS I LIKED:
The stellar cast includes Academy Award winners Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Brendan Fraser. Multi-award winners John Lithgow and Jesse Plemons round out the star-studded cast. Other noteworthy cast members are Lily Gladstone, Tantoo Cardinal, William Belleau, and Louis Cancelmi.I've been a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio since his earliest films and always thought he was a talented chameleon. He truly transformed into the character Ernest Burkhart in this movie. DiCaprio was paid $30 million for this movie, the most money of his career for one film.Robert De Niro looks fantastic. He's 80 years old but played a character who was 45-years old when these murders happened.Director Martin Scorsese quickly selected Lily Gladstone for her role because of the ""truthfulness in her eyes"" when they met over Zoom.Stunning cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto.We get to learn about Indian culture, language, and even an explanation of what the Flower Moon is.This was the last movie of actor Larry Sellers who was actually of Osage and Cherokee Indian descent.While there are Hollywood liberties taken with the film, it's based on a true story.I love how Scorsese incorporated the look and feel of black and white photos into the development of the story.Fun fact: We learn in the movie that it was the investigation of the murders in Osage County that was the first case given to the newly-formed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). President J. Edgar Hoover led the case.The movie cost $200 million to make. It's officially the most expensive biographical movie ever made.The movie was filmed in Oklahoma.The ending was powerful. I loved the idea and thought it was very clever to reveal the rest of the story through a radio show reenactment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
This movie is VERY long! While Scorsese is lauded as royalty in Hollywood, a really long movie is often a sign of indulgence by a director who doesn't have the grit to make needed edits. The story could have been told in much less time. Surprisingly, this movie is only 3 minutes longer than Scorsese's film The Irishman.I wanted to see the moment Leonardo DiCaprio's character fell in love with Lily Gladstone's character. I wanted that first, magical kiss. Instead, it goes from mild flirting in one scene to making out in the next.Rather than tell the story in a simple chronological order, it would have been more interesting to reveal various parts as the FBI uncovered them in their investigation.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is not an appropriate movie for kids. They'll probably be bored anyway.Profanity, including F-bombs
We see several people shot, resulting in blood splats.We see a man get poisoned to death.We see other bloodied, dead bodies.Violence with guns, knives, and fist fights.Murder, fires, destruction.!",positive
398,"I think the principle criticism of the film is its length, and the long and often tedious buildup to the point where it began to interest you, and then, thanks primarily to DiCaprio's performance it moved to its conclusion. If the introduction of the characters, and their various interactions had taken less time, and the better parts strung together more judiciously, that might have saved it. I do not think I would recommend it to my friends. The film is no Dances with Wolves, and the other films that depict the abuse of the Native American tribes. De Niro's voice almost reminded me of his character in Cape Fear. I might even say he was miscast. Not a bad film, just a disappointing one. Perhaps you'll like it better.",positive
399,"This was a hard watch. The subject matter was sad and it exposed the dark underbelly of human nature. As grim as this film was at times, the real victims went through this misery a thousand-fold.I love the fact that this film gave the Osage the time and the humanity that has been long overdue. The characters were fleshed out and real. They left me feeling in many ways like I wish I could have known them better. With a story like this one, they could have had a multiple part series, and still, there wouldn't be enough time to tell the story.It's always the everyday citizens who watch, but don't see. They allow things like this to happen. It is the common thread for human atrocities. This story is another reminder.",positive
400,"There's little doubt that Martin Scorsese sees this as one of his most serious films. Not only has he employed two of his pet male actors down the years, Leonardo De Caprio and Robert De Niro in lead roles (it's a wonder he didn't coax Daniel Day Lewis out of retirement) he confers a mammoth continuous running time to his subject, with no intermission, of almost three and a half-hours, even giving himself literally the last word in a brief acting part.in what is effectively an epilogue at the end. So I get it, the subject matter has obviously affected him personally and deeply and that certainly comes over loud and clear right from the first scene.Of course, kudos are due to Scorsese for bringing to light this little-known piece of American history which shames the white man's treatment of the Native American Osage people whose only ""crime"" is that they strike the black honey of oil on on their own ceremonial lands which naturally attracts the venomous bees of the mendacious and rapacious white usurpers. This they do by equally appalling means, firstly by insidiously marrying themselves to the Osage women-folk to put themselves directly in the line of succession ""head-rights"" to inherit the land, then by the simple cold-blooded murder of anyone in their way and lastly, as personified by De Niro's monstrous Uncle Ben ""but you can call me King"" Hale character, by setting up as a great benefactor and philanthropist, learning the Osage language and building them houses and schools to effectively buy their unsuspecting hearts and minds while all the while plotting how to take over every last inch of their land.Undoubtedly epic in scale, the film comes over as authentic down to the smallest detail as Scorsese painstakingly recreates the era. I also appreciated the way that he employs his two ""name"" stars as villains even if they are of the smiling variety and yes, he certainly doesn't miss his target in excoriating the white man's shameful treatment of the innocent and too-trusting Osage people. I had hopes initially that Lily Gladstone's Mollie character, who at first seems to be made of sterner stuff, might provide a stumbling block to De Niro / Hale's nefarious miscegenation plans, but sadly she too succumbs not only to future husband DiCaprio's dubious charms but also, almost, to the slow-poison he dutifully administers to her.It was impossible not to be drawn fully into this horrific take of death and deception, with my only complaint being the inordinate length it took the celebrated director to tell his take. Perhaps he felt he had to dot the ""i's"" and cross the ""t's"" in this, his valedictory statement, but for me the action too often went from profound to ponderous with too many characters saying too many words in too many scenes.Nevertheless, I made it through to the end without a break and am certainly the wiser for having this darkest corner of American history brought into the light. I can also see the read-across relevance of the tale to so many other historical acts of colonisation around the whole world. Convincingly acted from the biggest star in the cast down to the briefest supporting role, it's just a pity that the undoubted weight of the subject matter appears to have overloaded Scorsese's directorial vision to the partial detriment of the end movie, noble and enlightening as that vision may have been.",positive
401,"It's a shame that Martin Scorsese didn't better use the 3 1/2 hours in length. Glossing over the first important chapters of the book discussing oil head rights and conservatorships that the Osage tribe suffered under, undermined the story from the beginning as those two facts are the basis for everything that follows. Scorsese also missed a wonderful opportunity to expand on the intrigue of the investigation by federal agents leading up to the arrests. And while cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone, did a great job, the lack of cohesion and very unnecessary embellishments, which add nothing to the movie, lead to a disappointing and underwhelming movie at best.",positive
402,"Dicaprio is playing a seemingly dumb guy, but he's unrealistically dumb. He seems to love his wife but he doesn't care for her losing her family one by one and being completely broken by it? Doesn't make much sense, especially when he is given many opportunities to get angry at his uncle. He's not too dumb during his FBI interrogation too, which completely undermines his stupidity. I assume that Scorsese wanted not to deviate too far from the book? Because the movie is excellent, ignoring the above detail. Also, didn't know this was a scorcese film, yet I truly felt the godfather vibes at times. Just shows that genius is hard to hide.",positive
403,"Any movie by Scorsese starring DiCaprio and De Nero is an instant watch for me no questions asked.Whist Killers of the Flower Moon is very good I must say it does place behind other Scorsese classics like Goodfellas, the Wolf of Wall St, and the Departed.In short the movie is about the Osage Indians who are being dispossessed of their oil rich land rights In 1920's Oklahoma, in many cases brutally by townspeople and spouses they trust.DiCaprio gives one of his typical in depth character performances and De Nero is solid but its Lily Gladstone as DeCaprio's wife Mollie Burkhart who gives this movie its true heart. Mollie stuns with her looks and her quiet, gentle disposition that quite frankly I couldn't take my eyes off. But don't be fooled into thinking Mollie is a pushover, she's not, and her determination around knowing the truth provides the ying to her gentle natured yang as a wonderfully balanced character.You probably already know the movie is over three hours long and with a sagging middle could have been shortened by about an hour and not suffered as a spectacle.",positive
404,"The acting was great as you would expect and it's an important story that needed to be told. I felt the storylines and overall plots were not strong enough and I was waiting for something big to happen that never did.My main criticism of this movie is the same as many people as it was just far too long. It's not a good sign when you're wanting the film to end. I think Hollywood could benefit from a 15 min intermission halfway through like in Bollywood cinema. I think this project would've better as a three part mini series on a streaming service.The character development was ok but not enough to develop a strong enough connection with the main characters.Overall this movie is ok, just too long and not entertaining enough to forget how long you'll be sat there.",positive
405,"'Killers of the Flower Moon' is Scorsese's 3rd 3-hour-plus film in the past 10 years, and the 10th film directed by him starring Robert De Niro, and 6th film starring Leonardo DiCaprio. This film proves a case of ""if it isn't broke, don't fix it"". While not necessarily an ""epic"", it is a very well put together story, set just in the 1920s in Oklahoma, where Ernest (DiCaprio) is returning from WWI to live with his uncle, Hale (De Niro) and brother Byron (Shepherd). They're the white folk trying to cash in on the Native Americans who have found oil and are becoming rich - the Osage people.Rather than focusing solely on white men subjugating the native population, the film does well to establish a few key characters to follow over a number of years and watch their (unfortunately true) stories unfold. Critical to this is Mollie (Gladstone), an Osage woman, who Ernest falls in love with and marries. What happens to her and her extended family over the course of the film is both tragic and hard-to-believe, but also sadly within the realms of human evil.The film is helped by Gladstone delivering an excellent performance that holds everything together and acts as a benchmark for the other characters. DiCaprio is also good, but this is arguably De Niro's best performance in the last 15 years, as he plays a subtle hand as the seemingly benevolent Hale, as his true intentions are slowly revealed. The supporting cast are good, including Millie's sisters and the FBI/lawyers when they finally come into play in the final third. It's well-paced, with a good wrap-up and at no point did I feel bored. Probably not Scorsese's best ever, but up there with 'Casino', 'Raging Bull' and 'Gangs of New York'.",positive
406,"I was reluctant to watch Killers of the Flower Moon after my experience with The Irishman. But this time around I wasn't dying of boredom. In fact, I was fully engaged for this entire extended runtime. This was aided by the directing, performances, set designs and, of course, the ridiculously interesting story.The whole cast gives great performances, even the side characters. GOAT DiCaprio stands out the most, with one scene where I couldn't believe how good his emoting and facial expressions were.One thing I couldn't stop thinking about is, even after Western colonialism ""ended"" like we were taught in history class, it still continued in so many other ways. Not just continued, continues. America is still invading, killing and stealing from foreign countries like Iraq. And the pure racist hatred and genocide is still being experienced, most notably in Palestine.This movie is not just a history lesson. It's a damning indictment of our current society.Also, I went to school for 16 years. How was I never taught about this? Or the Tulsa massacre? Those tragic events must be remembered or we are doomed to repeat them, as we are currently witnessing.(1 viewing, 1/8/2024)",positive
407,"After everything I've been reading regarding this movie, including complaints about its length, etc., I must say this was a wonderful movie! I've done a lot of reading about the actual history of the events, and I give kudos to Scorsese and everyone involved for sticking to the truth. I also want to give a shout out to Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. He has not been nominated for any awards for this movie (it's mainly revolved around DiNero and Lily Gladstone). But once again, DiCaprio has proven how he is a superb actor. His range is astonishing ... compare this performance to what he did in ""Django Unchained"". I knew the first time I saw him in a movie (""what's eating Gilbert grape"") that this was an actor who would have a magnificent career. I highly recommend this movie!",positive
408,"Rating: 6.9Depressing tale about the price of greed on a morally grey protagonist. The elephant in the room is yes this movie is wayyy to long. The third act featured bloated scenes of tedious dialogue that could've been condensed (i.e courtroom scene). The characters are the highlight as they are all interesting, entertaining, nuanced, believable, and all around human which makes sense since this was based around a true story. I don't know the history but the realism in the end with Bill eventually getting out of prison while Ernest got life was well done. It did get repetitive with the whole a new indian has dirt on us so we have to kill him subplot since they did it 5+ times though overall an ok movie.",positive
409,"Jacks review:So my review of ""Killers of The Flower Moon"" Directed by Martin Scorsese best known for Films such as; ""Taxi Driver"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Irishman"" and I would imagine many people would consider other legendary accomplishments.Brief summary:
A very brief and spoiler free summary; Killers of the Flower Moon"" narrates a series of murders on the Osage reservation in Oklahoma. In the 1920s, members of the Osage tribe were killed as part of a plot to deprive them of their oil wealth. Author David Grann studies the murders, the resulting FBI investigation, and the structural discrimination against Native American people which inspired and enabled the killings.Casting:
I thought the casting was very well approached (although Scorsese had used some familiar faces from his previous work; Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio) for me the Stand out Performance was by lili Gladstone who plays Mollie Burkhart. She plays it as a women who seems to have already learnt what fear and pain really is, this is never explained, just shown through her eyes, the same eyes that seem to tell a million story's, ........ also adding to her character is a wise and calm woman with a smile that seems to be from an old portrait painting, and just to prove she is no fool ""Mollie"" from the get go understands that Ernest (Leonardo DiCaprio) is after her money, as proven when she states ""Coyote wants money"". A very thought out and relaxed understanding of the character in her research and character creation, it's no surprise she was won the Golden Globes for best actress and was nominated for an Oscar but just coming short of ""poor things"" Emma Stone who won the award for best lead actress.The film sound track:
The music I thought was very well done adding to the world building itself and keeping to the time period,
Robbie Robertson who scored the film died in August 2023; only two months before his 12th collaboration with Martin Scorsese, Killers of the Flower Moon.The cinematography:
The cinematography I thought was very well thought out and visually beautiful and seemed to flow from shot to shot with clean precision, most of the film was shot with a 35mm lens. Killers of the Flower Moon was filmed in and around the osage country and became the biggest movie ever made in Oklahoma (where the film is based). You felt like someone who was actually there instead of a view in front of the screen.So with that said the world building was incredible and just to be an extra in the film would of been a sight to behold.The cons:
For my self the two main critiques I have are as follows, the first; tempo, the tempo was one of the main issues I had with the movie, but I do find that with a lot or Scorsese movies, they tend to be slower but done for a reason, to really give the actors the time on screen and to show the deep character work, the second, the film could of been half an hour shorter for a better impact.Conclusion:
Would I recommend it to watch ? Would I watch it again? And whats the final score?Simply put yes I would recommend it. Watch it again? I found it very interesting to watch especially because its based on a true story and is an acting master class from all the cast, there is not weak link but would I rewatch ? Yes I would but not any time soon due solely on the length of the movie. Coming it at 3h 26m.My overall score is: 8.9 out of 10 (Green zone) ladies and gentleman thats a green light from me.Shannons score: N/AReview (vabaytum)/Notes: N/AGuest score/Notes : N/AReview: N/AOverall: N/AGreen zone (8-10) Yellow zone (~5-7) Red zone (1-4) Why did you even show me this zone!",positive
410,"Killers of the Flower Moon' raises the question: would it shine as bright without Scorsese? The film is anything but mediocre, featuring Scorsese's signature masterful direction, coupled with outstanding performances and a gripping, though stark, storyline that captivates.Yet, its overextended length is a notable flaw, stretching beyond what the plot requires. This dilutes the otherwise intense experience.Even though the movie has some really good parts, I don't think I'd watch it again. It definitely shows off Scorsese's talent, but it just doesn't hit the same high level as his other films. It's well-made, but when you compare it to his other work, it doesn't stand out as much. So, for me, it's not up there with the best of his movies.",positive
411,"Not insightful, not witty, nothing interesting, bad direction, but good acting. And that's unbelievable idiotic as it is based on amazing true story. They managed to screw up and americanized to the worst the whole story. Such a disappointed, i strongly suggest to check YouTube or read a book about the topic instead of wasting your time. This is just one big wanna-be artistic movie that in the end is just one big American fart. Avoid at all costs.Even the character buildup ia so lacking that you lose connection and interest so fast into the movie. I've seen bad long movies, but this was one of the worst.",positive
412,"This is one that stays with you. I didn't know much about it before I watched it. We watched it over the course of two nights and after the first night, I thought about it all day until we could finish it.The story is unbelievably tragic - hard to comprehend that it's actually true. And tragic movies aren't necessarily my thing but this was riveting.The cast was incredible. Lily Gladstone is a revelation. She fully embodied her character in such a way that, even though she had very little dialogue (comparatively), she was the most interesting character in the entire story. Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant (as usual), and disappears into this role as Ernest. He is able to make viewers feel sympathy for this character while at the same time reviling him for his unforgivable actions.The supporting cast had some wonderful surprises with actors at the top of their games - John Lithgow, Brendan Fraser, and Jesse Plemons, just to name a few.The only things I didn't like were (a) the length of the movie and (b) the conclusion. I was sort of jolted out of the trance of the storytelling when it so abruptly switched gears.",positive
413,"I waited to stream this movie and have been really looking forward to it. The audio is making it unwatchable. The dialogue is very low, practically inaudible and other sounds are deafeningly loud. Sometime the ambient sounds disappear which is also jarring. I have very close neighbors so I have to be considerate about the volume of my TV. Constantly turning up and turning down the volume is a drag and very distracting.So far the movie is really great. I love the casting and the setting and I'm a big a fan of Scorsese usually.I've only made it 50 minutes in. I'm still very interested in watching it so I may try again when I'm able to deal with it better.Edited to add: I watched it with an optimized sound system and it was phenomenal. Great acting, directing and cinematography of a respectfully told story.",positive
414,"First of all, I love you Martin Scorsese, but if it's so important to you that people see movies in the theater, then why do you make them 3.5 hours long?Secondly, for a movie about the ill treatment of indigenous people by white opportunists, it's a shame that more of this film couldn't have been told from the perspective of the indigenous people. Scorsese stays right in his comfort zone, giving us yet another variation on a mob story where the white mobsters are the focus. I guess there's nothing exactly wrong with that, except that if I want that I can just go watch other Scorsese movies that are better than this one. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is good. It's well made. There's nothing wrong with it. But there's something about it that left me cold. It never completely shook off the quality of history lesson enough to become a fully engaging story.Lily Gladstone is in fierce competition with Emma Stone for this year's Best Actress Oscar as I write this comment, but I was again disappointed by how passively the movie treats her. She falls out of it for long stretches at a time, and very little of this story is told from her point of view.This is far from being a miss, but it's also pretty far from joining the ranks of Scorsese's greatest hits.Grade: A-",positive
415,"Just Got out of Killers of the Flower Moon.I gotta say, the Run-time wasn't as bad(it was Still too long though, I think 30 minutes cut out of it would of been better) as I thought it would be, one of the aspects this film had at times, was going from 1. Start, 2. Incident, 3. Aftermath of Incident.1. Start and set-up of another Incident, 2. Incident, 3. Aftermath of Incident. Also the very subtle score going on in the background enhanced the scenes, which made them better.However.There's at least 2 things missing here for me -1. The Trial at the End was Very Good but it's not long enough, that trial needed to be a longer part of the overall film, I needed more testimonials and questioning.2. The Resolution between Mollie and Ernest when she suspects a thing and gets time in a room, at the end with Ernest, was ok, but some Strong dialogue between the two would of been better. ""What did you give me"", a look and then get up and walk, after all that Hell?What I liked about the Film -1. The Setting, I loved the setting of this film, that old early 1900's America with that old style shopping district and storesüíé2. The Plotline was Really Good.3. The Performances. We have 3 Strong Performances and a Solid Performance.üí∞ - Robert De Niro as William Hale - a Character Solely Driven by Money. Great Performance, anytime Robert De Niro was on screen, it was Great.üíâ - Leonardo DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart - an absolute Blithering Idiot of a Character, I mean he was an absolute Moron. Leonardo DiCaprio nailed it.üåπ- Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart - a character who has an Overall Demeanor of Sadness, even though she has all this money and even when she smiles, it's still Dampened. Another Great Performance.üö® - Jesse Plemons as Tom White - a Bureau Agent investigating the Murders. Solid Performance.4.üé• The Cinematography, some good shots in the Road/Store area Scenes and there was a Beautiful Shot in a certain Scene. Its when the Investigators are out meeting in the Dark with Cars. It was a Beautifully Shot Scene.5.üéµThe Score Fitted Perfectly for this film. And it Made Scenes better than if they didn't have it.6. üìª I thought the Radio Show Ending was a Great Idea. I really Liked it.Things I didn't Like or think are Missing -1. The Edits - Some Scenes just go on way too long. And I even think a certain Scene cuts too damn fast, (De Niro handing Alcohol to one of the Osage Women)2. Because of the Edits - the Film Feels too Long. Tighten some of the Scenes up. Overall, I think 30 minutes cut out in the right places would of alleviated that Bloat (Some people are even saying cut a whole 1 hour out of the Film).3. The 2 things that I think are missing, that I mentioned near the start of my review.Overall, it was Good Pushing Great, but not Excellent.",positive
416,"Waaaay too long, in my opinion, and a bunch of other peoples. I wasn't bored but I don't really feel like i was entertained either. It is a three and a half hour movie, and it still had no room for the ""whole"" ending. It just gives you a synopsis of what happened after. WackIn the end it gave me the Oppenheimer vibes with the courtroom and convicting the ""nice"" uncle guy. Except in Oppenheimer it was a twist, and here you always sorta knew or at least suspected he was a bad guy. And Oppenheimer just did it better. When I think about it, it wasn't really that much like Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was about science, which i like. Meanwhile this was about the government in the US not caring about Indians. Which is sad, but i didn't need to spend nearly four hours looking at it.The coolest thing about the movie is that Deniro's character acts sort of like Frank Reynolds from IASIP. Always going around scamming people.",positive
417,"Definitely worth seeing. I say ""almost a classic"" because it's just way too long to be the type of movie to watch over and over.The acting was incredible and the story was told in a very compelling and attention-grabbing way. There were only a few times during the movie when I thought ""how much longer?"" because it really was interesting throughout.Though I have no connections to the people in the story, it felt authentic and well researched. Hopefully that's really the case. But I also wish there had been more telling about the Osage people aside from these tragedies. I know it wasn't meant to be an educational movie but I wanted to learn more about their culture.",positive
418,"I was really expecting to be fully absorbed and excited by this film depicting a true story. Maybe there's something wrong with me or my anticipation was overblown but I was bitterly disappointed.Such interesting and thought provoking themes could have made a spectacular, exciting and engaging movie. The critics seemed impressed but as a cinema goer I found the film dull, slow and lacking in any emotional connection.Performances by De Niro and DeCaprio were on form but the much anticipated performance by the female lead I found featureless and lacking. Maybe her character was intentionally bland but I couldn't empathise the way I wanted to.In my layperson opinion this would have been better if twice as dramatic and half the length.",positive
419,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro star in the epic story of American life in the 1920's. Martin Scorsese selects the Osage Nation to bring awareness of the challenging relationship between the First Nations people and the European settlers in a riveting script.Although the movie is lengthy, it is required to provide justice to the interconnected storylines of the characters. Lily Gladstone (Mollie) was amazing throughout the movie. An actress I had never seen in any other productions I have watched, but nailed her role to perfection.If you have the time and want to be completely entertained, while also learning about the struggles of acceptance by the First Nations in a white man's society, it is a good choice.",positive
420,"Slooooooooow pace but the story deserves your patience. This is really a crime drama if you look at it a certain way, which demands that you have a little consideration and not expected to be entertained every second (hence the slow pace...?) Not going to pretend to be an intellectual because I just watched a Scorsese film, this style of storytelling isn't for me but damn, I was blown away to know what actually happened, this was very eye opening for me, who doesn't really know about old American history.Learned that Leo (brilliant acting, BTW) was supposed to play the investigator and he pushed to get his role changed to play the nephew; glad he did. DeNiro and Lily Gladstone - they are on the nominations list for the Oscars....yes?Despite the sloooooow pace, this was a very well done movie and given the story it was telling, I think it'll end up being one of the best films of 2023.",positive
421,"The nonfiction novel ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a riveting true story of how a series of murders on the Osage land inspired the creation of the FBI. It is a stunning expose of lost innocence, abject evil, and true heroism. The movie... gets bogged down in telling one person's story -- the husband of an Osage woman whose loved ones are mysteriously dying and who barely registers in the book -- and he's such a cipher that you never quite know if he's innocent or not... and that's deeply unsatisfying. You end up watching the movie and waiting and waiting and waiting for someone to STOP this band of criminals (the opposite effect Scorsese's more irreverently amusing tales of mob life - Casino, Goodfellas - have). In the book, the FBI is on the case much quicker and it makes the story feel less redundantly grim. I do think DeNiro is the surprise acting standout here. DiCaprio mugs a lot. And while I appreciate Lily Gladstone's authenticity in the role, her character is such a passive dud and her acting so limited to one glum note... any awards talk seems very misguided.",positive
422,"The movie was nice but i had more expectations.You can watch and enjoy this movie with a good plots and shots , a nice story and in the end nothing gonna happen. I liked this movie but at last there was nothing. And you will ask to your self ""why i spent all of my time for nothing""?While you watching story is very insane and make your brain busy in the story time.But the character Mollie Burkhart in the all of storyline was like a idot who can't to recognize her husband is a murderer and everytime her husband came out from house one of the family dies. In my opinion you should watch this movie for history, knowledge, actors and plot.",positive
423,"Right off, it's important to acknowledge the movie is long, however we all know most of us these days can binge watch an entire 10 episode series in 1 night so a 3 hour film which is essentially 3, 60 minute episodes shouldn't be a problem.The story, the quality of the production and the acting it's absolutely spot on and well worth investing your time in watching this very well crafted epic by one of the best directors in the film making world.Robert De Niro & Leonardo DiCaprio are both excellent as always under the guidance of Martin Scorsese.The real gem in the acting is Lily Gladstone she definitely deserves all the film awards available for her magnificent work.Movies like this don't get made to often these days, so ignore the negative reviews and discover this wonderful movie for yourself.",positive
424,"At the time of this writing (29 Nov 2023), the movie is rated an 8.0 on IMDB. There is no way this movie is that kind of movie! Just to give a little perspective to the 8.0 rating... that is Dances with Wolves, Life of Brian, Groundhog Day, The Revenant, Kill Bill, The Bourne Ultimatum, Dune, Avatar to name just a few. Those are all movies that you could watch multiple times, maybe even many times.To me Killers of the Flower Moon is a solid 6.0. The movie, as many others have pointed out, is incredibly long-winded and boring. At the end, I felt more like I'd just spent 3.5 hrs reading a script, or having it read to me. Let's just say, this is not 3.5 hrs where you are on the edge of your seat the entire time, or really, ever for that matter. OK, there are a few tense moments - have to give it that.You can just imagine the arguments in the editing room. How many times did Scorsese have to hear something along the lines of: Martin my man, bro, we just don't need that, we need to cut... (insert entire scene or part of scene). He surely got an earful. But the man held on!!I mean sure, it's a super interesting story, a piece of history that should be memorialized in some way. And the cast is amazing and Martin Scorsese has directed some truly incredible movies (Taxi Driver!).All the pieces are certainly there. But Killers of the Flower Moon is ultimately a disappointment.",positive
425,"Such an incredible, incredible story. I saw it a while back and am still affected by it. Certainly mind blowing because it happened. The fact that such brazen criminal activity could continue for so many years without letup or interference by the authorities is hard to accept. Hard to believe. To be honest I have never seen anything like this story. The premeditated evil coming from greed and utter disregard for life. On the other hand, the solid perseverance and calm courageous spirit of the victims is a mind blowing contrast that pervades the whole movie. The gap between the two was so huge that I started to feel I needed to suspend belief . Scorsese. So exquisite in how he gets to us. Impeccable acting by everyone. The script. The music. The way this shocking story is told. Amazing talent. So many strong emotions as I processed this tragic and shameful part of history . A global theme.",positive
426,"Was looking forward to watching this movie based on all the good reviews, but man what a disappointment. The story is ok and pretty interesting, but it's a very simple story and the story just can't carry a 3 1/2 hour movie and the way it's filmed and cut just means that it's extremely slow and way too long.I don't mind long movies if they keep me interested and captured but it took me 3 days to finally finish this movie as it just keeps dragging and dragging and it's painful to watch. It feels like they had a decent two hour movie and they tried to cut it to make it three and a half hours long.If this movie wasn't directed and starred by some of the biggest Hollywood names I'm certain that it would have gotten barely any attention and none of the glowing reviews you see from people who just simply are in awe of anything made my Scorsese or starring DiCaprio.",positive
427,"The epic cinematography (especially Scorsese's dynamic camera movements), the beautiful music and great acting performances by Lily Gladstone, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Jessie Plemons and Brendan Fraser enabled me to easily sit through the entire 3.5 hours without feeling bored.However, the movie didn't meet my expectations. Although my expectations might have been too high, here's what I didn't like as much:1. I just said I wasn't bored (yet), BUT there was no need for this movie to be 206 minutes long. Overindulgence doesn't make a good movie. I think some some scenes didn't add anything and could've been cut, while other parts were rushed through.2. The movie lacks the emotional heaviness that the true story carries. In fact, I didn't even really feel any type of emotion throughout the movie and there is no tension building. When I walked out of the theater I realized I hadn't laughed, cried, felt angry, sad, scared, happy, nervous, relieved or anything else during the movie. (And I promise, I am not dead inside.) Of course, the true story about the Osage murders is heartbreaking, but this movie just didn't evoke any emotions out of me.3. I think I wasn't very touched or moved by it, because I didn't experience enough depth with the key characters (particularly Hale, Mollie, Ernest and the victims who were murdered), which made it impossible for me to really understand them, feel for them, identify with them or feel any other type of connection with them. I would've liked more insight into their thought processes, beliefs, doubts, feelings, desires and their past.You don't REALLY get to know any of the villains. It's just made very clear that their main motivation was money, but that's pretty obvious and nobody needs to see this movie to know that. The movie seems to address Ernest's conscious to some extent in order to make you empathize with him a little bit, but you only notice his internal struggle because of his facial expressions and his contradicting actions. You never really get to know what he truly thinks, wants, loves, hates, doubts, or believes. And I would have appreciated some more context around other villains such as Hale, too. How did he get to that level of immorality? I'm not saying it should've been the main focus of the movie, but would give more context to the white settlers immorality.Also, you don't REALLY get to know the victims who were murdered, which makes it harder to mourn these characters in the movie. You know their names and you see their faces, but you don't know not much more about them, which makes their deaths in the movie less impactful.And finally, you don't REALLY get to know Mollie, which is honestly disappointing. She's one of the main characters, portrayed phenomenally, but you never really get to know what she thinks, how she experiences everything happening to her/her family/her tribe, and what goes through her mind. If the movie had focused more on her perception, it could've simultaneously provided us with a deeper understanding of the experiences from the Osage-tribes point of view.Maybe this seems like very exaggerated criticism, but hey listen... I just sat through a 3.5 hours long movie and in the end I still didn't really know what any character ever really thought or believed? Who they really were?4. My last, but main point of criticism is actually the one-sided perspective painting a distorted picture of the real story. The story is told from the perspective of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), one of the white settlers.I read that Scorsese actually rewrote the script, so the movie wouldn't be so much about ""white guys"" and that he wanted to avoid the white-savior trope. Nice attempt, but I think he failed, because although it's indeed not about ""heroic"" white people rescuing others, a white guy (Ernest) still takes the center stage and he shouldn't. The movie centers around Ernest, his conscious (not in depth), his internal moral conflict (not in depth either) and HIS side of the historical events. Eventually he is even portrayed as some sort of victim, because he was a weak, poor man who was dragged into the evil actions of his uncle Hale (Robert De Niro), while he is obviously not a victim but a perpetrator.In my opinion, the movie shouldn't have been centered around and focused on Ernest. He wasn't a victim. It isn't about him.Instead (or maybe additionally if you really want to address both sides), I would've appreciated the movie to be from the perspective of the real victims - the Osage tribe itself. In fact, the movie focuses only on one Osage-family and thus fails to provide a broader and deeper understanding of the tribe and its history. This movie is based on a book and Scorsese decided to rewrite the story a bit because he didn't want to focus on the FBI-investigations of the murders so much, but instead focus more on the villain-side throughout the occurrence of events, while he should've either focused more on both sides or more on the tribe-side.Scorsese consulted the Osage tribe before and during the making of this movie and he promised them that the story would be told through Mollies eyes. While filming, he realized the movie was telling the story too much form a one-sided and white settlers perspective still. He changed the script, tried to put more emphasis on Mollies part, and switched DiCaprios role. His attempt and intention to tell the story from the tribe's (Mollie's) perspective didn't really work out though, the story was eventually still told from the white settlers' (Ernest's) perspective. So unfortunately Scorsese didn't keep his promise to the Osage tribe.Indeed Mr. Scorsese, Mollie's role was a significant part of the movie, but the story of what happened to her and her tribe wasn't told through her eyes and not through the tribe's eyes.Indeed Mr. Scorsese, the white settlers aren't portrayed as white ""saviors"", but the movie still centers around white men who take away the stage from the actual victims.Actually, I realized it would've been epic if Scorsese had this goal in mind while making the movie - that he wanted us to be annoyed that the movie is once again all about white men taking the stage and not about the tribe, in order to highlight how things used to be at the time of the murders: it was all about white men and about their perspective, they didn't care about the tribe then either. However, I don't think Scorsese aimed to add that layer of symbolism to the movie, since he made his promises to the Osage tribe and publicly expressed his intentions with the movie.Overall, it's a good movie that I can recommend because of the strengths I mentioned in my first paragraph, but just not worth all the hype.",positive
428,"This film is over three hours long, and it is a masterpiece.Gven we are in the 21st-century, there's absolutely no chance that most of us will spend 3 1/2 hours watching a film. Which is a shame because if any of us had a longer attention span, then we could probably watch it in one go!However, break it up into chunks when you need to, and this film will make you emotional and sad and reflective all at the same time. There's very few films that any of us would even consider investing the time and energy into about a store with that we don't know, set a long time ago that doesn't feature people wearing capes or shooting laser beams out of their eyes. However, this is worth the investment.The performances are easily Oscar-worthy and will most likely be overlooked, as is the photography. If you don't like this film, you don't understand film. If you tend to watch Netflix or Marvel films, then I urge you to take some time sit in the comfortable chair, grab yourself a drink, open your mind, and invest in filmmaking excellence. You will not regret it.",positive
429,"""Killer of the Flower Moon"" is a meticulously crafted cinematic endeavor helmed by the legendary Martin Scorsese. With a cast that includes some of the industry's finest, the film paints a haunting portrait of the harrowing series of crimes that unfolded in 1920s Oklahoma. While the performances, led by the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, are undoubtedly commendable, the film's extended runtime of almost 3 hours and 30 minutes can certainly challenge the endurance of even the most dedicated moviegoers.Despite its valiant attempt to capture the essence of David Grann's compelling non-fiction book, the slow pacing of the narrative seems to stretch the story thinner than necessary, ultimately leading to a sense of dragging monotony. Furthermore, the film struggles to match the levels of anticipation and excitement that the pre-release hype had generated, leaving me feeling underwhelmed by the final product.However, it's crucial to highlight the film's impressive attention to detail, reflected in the intricate period sets and the impeccable costume design that transports audiences back to the era. Scorsese's signature cinematography also captures the stark beauty of the Oklahoma landscape, adding an evocative layer to the storytelling. While it may not fully live up to the towering expectations it generated, ""Killer of the Flower Moon"" still stands as a respectable tribute to the victims of a tragic chapter in American history and a testament to the artistry of the individuals involved in its creation.In a similar vein to Martin Scorsese's ""The Irishman,"" the lengthy runtime of ""Killer of the Flower Moon"" poses a significant challenge to its overall impact. Clocking in at nearly three-and-a-half hours, the film's prolonged duration affects the pacing and, in turn, the audience's engagement with the narrative. Just as ""The Irishman"" grappled with the repercussions of its extended length, ""Killer of the Flower Moon"" encounters a similar hurdle, with the plot struggling to maintain momentum and the audience's investment in the story and characters waning over time. While the ambition of a comprehensive storytelling approach is admirable, the risk of losing viewers' attention due to a bloated runtime remains a pertinent consideration for filmmakers aiming to deliver a captivating and immersive cinematic experience.",positive
430,"I really tried to like it but it was all 'show' and no 'go'.This movie was a 'how to' for budding filmmakers, sure, the director is a master, the costume designer did their research, the sets were accurate, the score not bad. But how about a little story telling, character building or intrigue? The technical skills were on show but the story telling was drab and drawn out. It's almost as if in the search for recognition the audience was forgotten. It was cut paste for over 3 hours, a murder, a death, another murder interceded with some culture moments, so on and so forth. I didn't connect with or enjoy any of the characters. None of the men had any redeeming features or personality to speak of. I noticed DeNiro unnecessarily repeating himself a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot it was frustrating; move along. Every moment with DiCaprio or Deniro seemed anxiety riddled or creepy. The movie is dark in a way that wasn't planned I'm sure. The highlight was the female lead but even she was dreary, before she got ill. Was everyone on Prozac? I know this movie is based on a true story but a little poetic/dramatic license is required to entertain....and the winner is....not the movie goer.",positive
431,"The movie was very touching for me. I had no idea about Osage nation before and now through this movie I totally understand why I had no. I felt very sad for Osage people. Even though the movie explains many details for 3 hours which were not enough for such a story, after the movie I kept searching and reading about Osages. I hope people's greed will end one day.Especially Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone played their role very succesful. They managed to give all the feelings to audience.I think there are more heartbreaking stories about Indians and the genocide. I wish more movies will be filmed later.",positive
432,"I watched and rewatched it and never once did i think the movie is too long. I ll happily take the length if it means i get to enjoy the acting and how the story unfolds which i do.Robert De Niro gives an awesome performance of the bad ass guy William Hale that takes advantage of the Osages and even Leonardo Di Caprio's character. He truly is only after one thing. Money. The rest are secondary so not just the Osages are expendable in his eyes, anyone in his circle can be expandable if it is at the expense of his freedom and way of living. He is smooth and effortless in wearing his compassion hat, seemingly putting his concerns for the welfare of the Osages first in public but in front of Ernest Burkhart he just takes the compassion hat off without hesitation showing how little the truly cares about them. He has no difficulty manipulating people to 'build a bridge' for him to cross to get to the money he desires and also manipulating others to make witnesses disappear. Hale has the entire Fairfax region under his thumb especially Ernest and rather skillfully i might add and De Niro as usual makes William Hale compelling and intriguing with his knack of disappearing into the characters he plays.Speaking of Leonardo Dicaprio's character Ernest Burkhart, i love how he navigates between his love for his wife Mollie Burkhart even though he agreed with his uncle to assist in killing her and his lack of regard for the rest of her family agreeing without much hesitation to be involved in killing her loved ones to get money for his uncle and himself. I was hoping for him to take the additional step to tell the truth to his wife that he poisoned her given that he choose to tesify but i ll happily go along with the story accepting that such a person that do horrible things to the one he loves most is not likely to admit such truth due to his fear of losing her as he knows deep down she has the right to leave him under such circumstances. In his mind if he tells her the truth, she's not going to accept him anymore. I do think that he is wrong. Even if Mollie hears that her husband tried to kill him, she just needs him to be honest with her and she will still choose to forgive him because of the love she has for him. I think in Ernest's mind he justifies killing her by believing that he is putting an end to her pain so he probably thinks his actions are out of love. He feels that her death is inevitable so why not take away her pain? I understand his motives even though i dont think he is entirely doing it out of love, i believe greed is also involved so his actions are not so innocent as he would like to believe. Just like what Ernest says "" I love money almost as much as my wife"" which speaks what his intentions are. Dicaprio performance makes this love for Mollie tangible and thus making him more human and sympathetic than his actions would suggest making a seemingly deplorable character worthwhile to invest emotionally in.Lily Gladstone who plays Mollie Burkhart gives a very tender, vulnerable, and enduring performance choosing love even though she has alot of hate in her heart from what has been done not only to her family but to the Osages in general. She is the engine that drove the justice train, headstrong, determined and full of love. Her decision to stick to her husband for so long shows how much she values family and how much hope and love she holds for him. I admire her resolve and her goodness in heart to deal with evil not with violence but with patience and understanding. I think that even though she divorced him, she never stopped loving him. Her heart was just broken too much for her to take it. Gladstone's subtle performance is the highlight of the movie for me.A notable mention is Brendan Fraser who does such a good job of being Hale's Lawyer, a character i dislike. I dont even really dislike De Niro's character despite the evil he has done. This shows what Scorsese is capable of in terms of getting the best from actors who on paper might not seem compatible for the role.I am also delighted to see Jesse Plemons in the movie as Tom White who shows understanding and great compassion towards Ernest Burkhart. I think Tom sees that Ernest is being used and feels for him even though what he is still complicit in the many bad deeds that are piloted by the seeming untouchable King Hale. Jesse Plemons makes Tom White multi demensional and not just someone sent by J Edgar Hoover to investigate the matter of missing Osages.But of course its not just the acting of the top stars but from everyone who i feel did a great job collectively in bringing the story to life.On top of the acting, there is the camera movement, visuals, style, story flow and the creative ending touch in which Martin Scorsese pays tribute to real life Mollie Burkhart's daughter.All in all, i think the movie length fits the way the story is meant to be told, there is not a scene which i feel does not contribute to telling the story. The depth of characters is partly derived from Scorsese and the actors conviction in staying truthful to what happened and also the quality of the script which makes the dialogue really enjoyable.Worth my time so too long? I dont think so. Its a slow burn but a wonderful slow burn indeed for me.",positive
433,"This is a true cinematographic masterpiece based on a very meaningful and true story. Unfortunately the deeper meaning resonates with a lot of other situations in society which makes this movie even more amazing to watch and study. Martin Scorsese has really made one of his most impressive cinematographic masterpieces ' Killers of the Flower Moon' is overshadowing the creative and literary value of all of his previous masterpieces put together from my point of view. If only more movies were this meaningful and revealing as this one , this World would be a much better place to live ... very highly recommended!",positive
434,"I was hoping for something at least a little like 'There Will Be Blood' with oil prospecting and infrastructure as the Osage tribe gain their wealth. There is one scene showing oil if I recall correctly, and it's a few seconds long.Instead, it's just a snooze fest of people in the way of De Niro's character's family's inheritance getting killed surreptitiously; all overly complicatedly explained by inheritance procedures of some kind or other, with the charm of some tribal customs thrown in and extremely rare romance. And the mastermind of the murders justifies it all with the amenities he's brought to the town for the tribe; a bit clich√©.There is great acting - some genuine human bonds being shown and broken, and there's the fact that the film... finally.... ends.",positive
435,"Enjoyed it a lot!Not one of the best movies by Scorsese and Leonardo. But I certainly enjoyed it. Watched it two times and thought it was good but should have been a series rather than a movie. Why?I think the story deserves much more. The atrocities native Americans endured was much deserved of a fully detailed explanatory series. Some points in the movie I think I needed more elaboration. Background about the issue and more insight. The movie has several slow parts here and there where it got a big boring but the story is generally good.Nothing bad about the acting!! Except I feel like maybe the movie wasn't a role that Leonardo could get an Oscar in. I thought my favorite actor was definitely Robert De Niro, amazing performance couldn't have done better in my opinion. The downfall and his dignity even though he was a criminal he stood strong and felt no regret.Also, Leo's character where he trusted and loved his uncle so much that until the end he didn't feel like his uncle was the criminal. Also, the loving wife who knew her husband was using her and led her through pain, but she loved him and saw good in his heart.Honestly, the story was so good it should have been a series (longer). I want to see more insight into the Native Americans. What happened previously to the story and insight into what happened after. The story is so eye opening that I want to see more!!",positive
436,"I've got no problem watching a 3 & a half hour film as long as the content warrants the runtime.It takes almost 90 minutes, which is a film in itself, for the film to get going. Many scenes drawn out & over played again unnecessarily. I love Scorcese's films & the runtime of Goodfellas & Casino went by in no time as the films had such good pace. This film lacks all the pace & meanders along with so many scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor.Killers of the Flower Moon does not warrant the 3hr+ runtime. Could & should have been 2hrs & would have resulted in a much more interesting & less drawn out film.",positive
437,"Scorcese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is simply too long. It is too long by one hour.How do I know that? Here's how.Its running time is 3.5 hours.At 2.5 hours the murders and associated other crimes have all been committed. The guilty have all been identified. And the two most important of the guilty are in prison. In adjacent cells.So, you ask, what's left? Good question. Scorcese made the creative decision(s) that the audience would now be interested in the courtroom dramas that play out in which the two defendants are brought before the scales of justice. Scorcese was wrong about this. I did not need to visit that courtroom or any of the other locales in which that final hour plays out.Another faulty decision is the film's final scene. It is a 1930's radio broadcast during which what happens to the film's main characters is described and detailed for the audience. Of course this detailing of future events has been done dozens of times before, nearly always with text displayed on the screen going character by character and letting us know how long they would live and in what circumstances. But this ... this is Scorcese we're talking about and simple text would be too ... simple. Uncreative. So we get the radio epilogue and it looks completely different from the rest of the film and, of course, adds another fifteen minutes where no additional minutes is advisable.You might wonder about my rating of '8' stars. It is because (a) it's a beautifully filmed work (b) it contains brilliant performances by DeNiro, DiCaprio, and as Decaprio's Osage Indian wife, Lily Gladstone. And (c) it's a story well worth the telling.At 2.5 hours we've got a classic.At 3.5 we've got an error in judgement.Sorry, Martin. But true is true.",positive
438,"Look it was not a bad film, the cinematography was amazing but that is really the only thing that blew me away. All in all I thought it was a disappointing film, the cast was great however I did not find the acting to be good at all which I did not anticipate. Leo is one of the greats but this was a very forgettable performance for me and I am very confused by the praise for the female lead. I was not impressed by her at all. I felt all the characters came across as dumb and boring. The thing that really got to me though was how unnecessarily long the movie was, there are 15 minute scenes that should have been cut completely. Actually now that I'm thinking about it, it was a bad film.",positive
439,"Last night, my wife and I had the pleasure of watching Killer of the Flower Moon (2023) on the big screen. The film delves into an oil rush on a Native American reservation and the ethical challenges that arise in the pursuit of wealth, leaving us questioning trust, love and the pursuit of happiness.This cinematic gem is directed by the iconic Martin Scorsese (Casino) and features a star-studded cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Lily Gladstone (Winter in the Blood), Brendan Fraser (The Mummy), John Lithgow (Cliffhanger) and Jesse Plemons (The Irishman).Killer of the Flower Moon stands out for its exceptional craftsmanship, a captivating storyline, and remarkable performances from the cast. The plot unfolds in a unique setting with fascinating circumstances, creating an engrossing narrative. DiCaprio's performance is nothing short of exceptional, with his nuanced mannerisms, expressive facial cues, and compelling dialogue. The supporting cast equally delivers robust performances. While the storyline and conclusion might follow somewhat predictable paths, the exploration of the Native American experience adds depth and intrigue. The resolution and ultimate outcomes are satisfying and rewarding.In summary, Killer of the Flower Moon is yet another Scorsese-DiCaprio masterpiece, offering a unique storyline, well-developed characters and captivating circumstances. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",positive
440,Watched it because of Gladstone and she is great but unfortunately it was mostly De Niro and Di Caprio showing off and in general too many men talking. Why not give more screen time to the women and the Osage?De Niro's character made me sick to my stomach. It's a hard film to watch and the duration doesn't feel justified. Why so much screen time for the white privileged men when it should be a film about the indigenous who only get a few scenes. I'm really over it and will not watch another Scorsese movie. In the end it is just old white men and old white money making a Hollywood film about a story that I rather watch being told by indigenous film makers.,positive
441,"A pathetic and nonsensical telling of murder and tragedy. The scenes are hurried and often confusing. It feels like you are watching a poorly done graphic novel with half the pages torn out. DiCaprio is reduced to dozens of one-word lines. He has to be ashamed of the results. De Niro plays the villain without an ounce of complexity or humanity. He is probably not ashamed give the size of his ego. Lily Gladstone's performance rises above the others but not enough to save the movie. This was Scorsese at his worst, one of our most over-rated directors.It's sad that so much money and talent were wasted in the production of Killers of the Flower Moon. It's 90-plus Rotten Tomatoes rating raises the suspicion of manipulation by studios. Reviewers who contributed positive reviews need to do some soul searching and stop writing for free tickets.",positive
442,"Marking the first feature film collaboration between Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro & Leonardo DiCaprio, Killers of the Flower Moon brings the real-life story of the Osage murders to the screen in extensive detail, covering the web of lies, deceit & corruption that paved the way for the serial killings to take place, and is masterfully anchored by first-rate performances from its impressive ensemble. Enormous in length, exhaustive in research, engrossing in narration and essential in historical context, this absorbing account of America's relationship with its indigenous population is yet another artistic triumph for the revered filmmaker.",positive
443,"This movie, about the Osage people who are murdered one by one, is a great thriller movie!Yes, it's slow and long, but it's always engaging at some level as long as you keep attention. Every scene has something to do with the story and the story is constantly evolving.The movie has a fantastic script, excellent acting and amazing production design. The conversations are often interesting to follow with the actors convincing us, especially Leonardo DiCaprio (as Ernest Burkhart). His performance in this movie is one of the reasons why he is my favorite actor. The long takes of DiCaprio in the third act is one of best performances I have ever seen because his expressions are just perfect! In terms of production design, almost every scene contains the big scaled environment in the background in Oklahoma in the 1920s; the people, the buildings and all the other stuff bring this movie to life in such an authentic way. This was a nice experience because the movie shares its story in an impressive way by combining a thriller story with engagement and culture.This is a slow-burning thriller with an authentic depiction of the Osage people. DiCaprio gives a nuanced performance, and the movie's greatest strength is its realism.",positive
444,"Low9/10 (future to change to a 10 depending on rewatch)(also some spoilers at the end) wow what a beast of a movie. For an almost four hour film, this kept my attention the whole time (besides 2 bathroom breaks which I really couldn't hold, had to run to the seats). Can't really say one scene was not important or vital to the story. And what a story it is. I picked a good crowd to watch it too because the way they would react to these situations were so entertaining, really made the twists and turns that much better. The way it ended also gave weight to the reality. Kind of joking about the true crime nature of this country that turns these real life heinous actions into subject matter. Next it's also GORGEOUS. I love how it was shot and loved how much thought went into it and it's movement. A lot with how it's shot also strengthened character motivations and themes. The acting, especially from Lily Gladstone, Deniro mostly and Dicaprio did the best with bringing these real people to life. This isn't a dig btw but the main character is probably martin scorsese's most VIAL, most contemptible yet. It might be the quarter indian that's angry in me but the way this character would do bad things then justify it and feel bad afterward was akin to bojack horseman and just like with him, I got sick of it (more here because this was based on REAL people). Some for a reason said Dicaprio's performance was bad but I disagree, he play's a sniveling two-timing weasel to a T and that makes his failed redemption and rejection from his wife that more satisfying, at least to me.",positive
445,"At a whopping 3 hours and 26 minutes this is far too long without having a break in the middle. I enjoyed the film but neccesity dictated that I had to break it into 2 seperate sections. There is no way that its possible fpr most people to sit for almost 3.5 hours without having a much needed break. The film or what I have already seen was enjoyable but my solution was to leave after 2 hours and rto eturn tomorrow to watch where I have left off. Fortunately I have a cinema pass that gives me unlimited visits otherwise I would have had to pay for two seperate tickets, (or perhaps that the intention to boost ticket sales).Other notably long films in the past have been Ben Hur. At 3hrs 42 minutes excluding an intermission, The Sound of Music. 2hrs 54 minutes excluding an intermission,Titanic. 3hhrs 14 minutes. Avatar: The Way of Water. 3hrs 12 minutes and so on.It seems that apart from the rating of a film for age groups it may soon be necessary for a warning of the possibility of Deep Vein Thrombosis and the need for cinema goers to wear compression stockings.The film could easily have beem a really great masterpiece if it had been edited down.",positive
446,"This masterpiece could only have been just 2 hours and 30 minutes..altough deep emotional one. Nice work from these legends.Leo fenomenal performance in his original style..in almost every movie he seems agitated, a little bit naive, remembering Revolutionary Road..also great performance by de Niro also fits perfect in the villain role, and surprise Jesse Plemons appears perfectly at the end of the movie and also brilliant, simple performance..I think Mollie will be nominated for Oscar. Leo and de Niro are the same, they already achieved everything :). Also Brendan Fraser nice corrupt lawyer..
After all 9 from me.",positive
447,"The cast, specially Gladstone, amazing. We know how great Scorcese is, and it is based on an amazing true story that deserved to be told and it pays tribute to many that deserved it...
... but it is simply too long. It drags along most of the time, be it the loooooong dialogs, of while filming long scenes. It doesn't know if it is a detective thriller of sorts, a time piece, a mere drama or a ""based on a true story"" type of movie.It delivers tho, and that in all that it does: The actors, photography, costumes and the scenery. I have to say tho, I could chop 90 minutes out of it... the first 90 could have been summed up in 10...
I cant help the feeling it is simply an old style movie. Outdated. A movie that could have been great 30 years ago, but not today. It lacks Zeitgeist, it doesn't even try.A must watch for many reasons, just nit pick the great 100 minutes out of the 200+...",positive
448,"I see a lot of middling review scores here from people who are complaining about the movie being too long. How many of these people are just 'proud', likely right-wing Americans looking for any excuse to downvote a movie because it gives them a three hour lesson on their torrid and shameful history, though?I'm not what you would call a seasoned ""Scorsesian"" but this is my favourite movie of his now. I'm from Australia and I have a developed interest in indigenous people, particularly of North America, so I was naturally interested in this movie well before it's release. It's so good to see old stories like this about indigenous people given the big budget, big-name director treatment.Honestly, I'm sure there were some noble white Americans around at this time, (Jessie Plemmons character being the only one I can recall in this particular story) but history lessons like this tend to bring you to the startling realisation that the foundation of America was built by brigands, thieves and killers.",positive
449,"The acting was magnificent. Leonardo Capriano, and Lily Gladstones an amazing job. Robert De Niro killed it as the creepy and somewhat sadistic De Niro I know from Cape fear. The production value is on point nothing technical stunk about it.It was an interesting story, and I actually enjoyed it some more but I felt that it was built as being this crazy thriller like death and violence but it's more of a Shakespearean tragedy. It's a slow burn Shakespearean tragedy that takes a while to unfold. Some will love it and others will hate it. I think they should've focused on telling a different character's story than the main's.",positive
450,"Long and terrific!!!!!Very rarely you come across a movie where every single performance is top notch. DiCaprio - great as always.I had certain impression that when DeNiro is on the cast I can, up front, tell how he would act. He is great actor with many different and fantastic roles - but somehow you could always expect, so to say, sort of the same DeNiro's acts, poses and faces. NOT THIS TIME! IMO - in this movie he proves once again how great actor he is. Gladstone is also exceptional.It is a long movie indeed. But I would not cut a single second. Yes sitting in the cinema for over 3 h can be cumbersome, but once you get it on ATV+ I am pretty sure you will appreciate the movie length. But you need top notch recliner for that.",positive
451,"I do agree that Martin Scorsese can bring the best out of a good script and a team of known actors.But this time, this movie is so much of a re-packaging of Scorsese's ""done-this"" and ""shown-that"".Maybe a western needs a different way of directing and acting than the monumental mob films of Scorsese, or most probably the top actors of the film do not fit convincingly in this era of westerns, no matter how hard they try.Definitely good script and masterful representation of a deeply sad and shameful time, but still DiCaprio cannot rise to the occasion and depict an original character, so much needed in this ambience.As the movie goes on, DiCaprio more and more falls into the trap of following (if not copying) the personality, manners and gestures of Marlon Brando (as Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather""), in a way that I think gives away his awkwardness to come up with a genuine profile for his character.Yes, this is a good movie dealing with a very sensitive issue, but in all honesty I was expecting a way more sophisticated crew from this great director and his cast.",positive
452,"Yes... this is supposedly BASED on true events. Yes, these people were done wrong. But this movie is no different from every other modern piece that has come out in the past decade. The entire premise is skewed around the bianco bad narrative. Every bianco character is skeezy, manipulative, underhanded and/or just plain evil. The other peoples, of course, are all strong, brave, and the very image of greatness. People are individuals, some good, some evil.... this movie does not reflect REAL Truth. It instead portrays truthâ„¢ as hollywood sees it.The acting is better described as overacting. The plot is trite. The filming looks like it was done by a film school drop out. The characters are not likable at all. That it takes three and a half hours to tell this 'story' is ridiculous. 90% of the film could have been cut and it would have still been boring.Every word here is MY OPINION. That is the very definition of a review... MY OPINION on what I thought about the movie.",positive
453,"I mean let's face it, it a smidge long but it didn't feel like it was three and a half hours long. It flowed very well for being as long as it was and the acting is superb! I'm not the biggest Leo fan fun he did a very good job on this. DeNiro is as good as he ever was, he is one of my favorite actors. To add to all of that it is directed and written by arguably one of the greased movie directors of all time! I have NEVER seen a Scorsese film that I didn't thoroughly enjoy! I think Killers of the Flower Moon will be another movie that is considered one of his best. It isn't Goodfella's or anything but it is an overall great movie. Worth the time to watch!",positive
454,"Martin Scorsese's 25th film is not his longest. The ""Irishman"" is longer in three minutes. That is a fact. Another fact is that Scorsese tends to over direct and over stretch his films and some viewers might find it tedious, but the ones that like or love this epic director's movies understands that he only wants to take his audience to a long, personal and very intimate journey.This movie is telling the story of the Osage Indian people that encountered the black gold, after got deported to a land in Oklahoma. They start living the white American rich lives, but it is only a show on the outside, while the white Americans are still controlling them, marring their women and finally get a hold on all of their oil wealth.The main complication for the Osage people is that they are being killed, one after the other, and thus their presence gets thinner and their money is filtered into a small Target Audience. It is not very difficult to trace the money trail and seems that all ways are leading to one snake head, that seems so friendly and almost a part of the Osage community.The film is telling the story of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) a former army cook, that got crippled in the war and came back to make money, under his uncle's wings. He is falling in love with a native woman and they take the journey, with all what this journey contains - love, oil and oil money.This movie is criticizing the money grabbing nature of man, especially American man. It is widely talking about racism and of course about love and all its toxins; especially while looking about the Burkharts couple relationship, where it seems to have true love, but also true opportunism and a lot of evil, under and over the surface.Leo DiCaprio nails it with a stunning role, almost as usual - shines and almost overtrying to be rememberable with an unforgettable suffering jaw, teeth and accent. 80 years old (!!!) Bobby DeNiro is showing, once again, that none of his B-Movies defines him and we get a third side as the wonderful, anonymous Lily Gladstone with a quiet and powerful.Jesse Plemons gets a fantastic tailor-made role, which he performs accurately and we get small glimpses from massive actors such as John Lithgow and Brendan Fraser almost out of nowhere, somewhere near the end of the movie.Another winner from Martin Scorsese's directing hands and one that is going to talk very loudly at the next Oscars Academy Awards. It is long, but can't think of a movie I would like to spend my time as in one of Scorsese's. Each and every minute is so accurate and important that I can't think what I would leave on the editing floor.",positive
455,"Main problem with the film is it's excessive length. Could have easily been shorted by 30 to 45 minutes with better editing. The other major problem, from my point of view, is leaving out most of the FBI's involvement in the story. The book spent a great deal of time documenting the FBI's part in solving the crimes. The movie, not so much. On the plus side of the ledger, the acting was quite good. DeNiro and Decaprio were well cast and both did an excellent job as the main protagonists. The rest of the cast was quite good as well. The story depicts a very dark part of American history. One that I'm sure most Americans are not familiar with. Well worth the telling.",positive
456,"People rating this film low because their expectations for a 4 hour long riveting masterpiece was not met are fools.Objectively this movie is really really great.Perhaps it's a bit long.Perhaps it isn't the fast paced thrill ride you expected.But for heavens sakes it's a great film. Scorsese chooses to leave this movie at a whopping 3 and a half hours because he doesn't seem any part of this tragedy worthy of sacrifice. After viewing the film this is understandable, this story ought to be told in its entirety for the sake of its torn subjects.This film is a ripe depiction of the malevolence of man and how far down the rabbit hole of hell that malevolence will take your life. This being said it is a slow burn. It is also not uplifting or satisfying in anyway. It's a bummer. A bummer that should be watched, that should stand as a testament of living an honest good life.",positive
457,"I didn't do enough checks before seeing this film. My wife asked me so let's go. I sensed a Tarantino nuance at first but not as much as his as I know. So it's true it is not his fruit.Story is so simple and predictable. Sadly true happened or still happening in many nations when it comes about greed and one innocence. But anyway the simple and predictable plot is well packed by good cinematography.Caprio in the other hand was not digging up enough his acting skill to enrich his character. I'm thinking like maybe a traumatic war veteran with wounds in his soul then falling in love but all the head bumps he got went him bit of lunatic.My high appreciation for many native American actors that had shown the complexity, the confuse, at the age of how they welcome settlers with trust end up one horrible genocide.",positive
458,"If this film was released back in 2010 it would be an absolute banger and one of the most loved film back then but unfortunately it was released in 2023, when people can't just sit 15 minutes without scrolling Tik-Tok. These people on IMDb are crazy, they can't find anything bad aboat the film except ""It was too long"". It's injustice to give the film low rating because it is 3h and 26m long and other than that, can't find anything bad aboat it. For me, this film was one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had, I watched it twice in cinema and 10 out of 10, I can't find anything bad aboat it.",positive
459,"One of the few movies I liked this year, though it really is too long but Thank God I watched it at home.I'm going to mention the good and then the bad about this one.THE GOOD:
1. Of course I cannot emphasize more on the fact that DiCaprio, De Niro and Gladstone nailed it as usual. De Niro representing the capitalist white man who will do anything to get filthy rich, DiCaprio, who I think was a mere puppet in his uncle's hands, and Lilly, this woman who just wants to be loved for who she is, not for the money.2. I enjoyed the music, it was awesome actually.3. Now the most important thing in my opinion is the fact that such a story would never see the light and gain such attention without the great effort Martin Scorsese has put into it.Such tragic yet true story should be told to everyone, everyone should know this part of America's history, and of the white man's morals.This movie showed it very well, to what extent the white capitalist thinks he's above all. There's a scene in which Ramsey refuses to kill for money after being asked by Ernest to kill Henry, but after knowing Henry was an Indian, he says something like: okay, now that's different!Hurray y'all!I felt so much compassion, empathy and love towards Indians who had to go through all of this just for some white people to get to buy jewelry and cars.THE BAD:
TOO LONG A MOVIE !You'll leave your ass-print on the seat yo!I think with such too long movies the seats should be toilet seats, you know for compliance and so, because you'll need it.",positive
460,I think this story was well told. Going into details and not missing important things takes time and Martin Scorsese did just that. It did not feel too long at all.Movie really reflects on how we humans are capable of most despicable shameful things. How we can betray anyone we care about.It also reflects perfectly the dark side of American history and indigenous people should be pleased about how this story was told.For me personally this movie could have featured more drama and more thrill.All in all it is a must watch movie and you will not regret time and money spent.DiCaprio definitely getting nomination for his role.,positive
461,"Hey, Streamers! I know it's spooky season, but it's also that time of year when ""prestige"" movies start to flood the theaters. There have been fall film festivals teeming with Oscar hopefuls that are now being released to the general public. One of this year's most anticipated movies is Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, which is out in theaters this weekend and will be on AppleTV+ later this year. It's a 3+-hour epic about another tragic, little-known true story from American history. Here's how it went.Martin Scorsese directed and co-wrote Killers of the Flower Moon with Eric Roth based on the book of the same name. Apparently, the book focused more on the investigation in the 1920s by federal agents of the unsolved murders of multiple members of the Osage Nation but that's just a small sliver of this film. Here, we follow Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo Dicaprio), a former servicemember, who returns to Oklahoma to work with his uncle, William ""King"" Hale (Robert Deniro). Ernest is like many other white men who have flocked to the area to mooch off of the Osage Nation due to the oil that was found on their land. Many of those white men married Osage women in order to gain access to their head rights. Ernest falls in love with an Osage woman, Molly (Lilly Gladstone), and marries her. Then Molly's family begins to die one by one under mysterious circumstance. Dastardly deeds and scheming hijinks ensue.Well, it is no wonder this film is over 3 hours since that synopsis barely scratches the surface of what's going on in Killers of the Flower Moon. Scorsese attempts to whittle down a complicated, sprawling American tragedy into a digestible story about the tragedy in one Osage family. The elements that are there work really well, but there's an ineffable thing that's missing. It almost seems like these events needed longer to develop - maybe a movie wasn't the right medium for this. On the other hand, if this movie wants to be a mystery, crime thriller, there is an element of suspense that's missing. The film never really has the energy of thriller. There are definitely tense moments, but the runtime cannot sustain that tension.Nevertheless, the production values of this movie are top notch. The costumes of the 1920s people and the Osage tribe members are eclectic and interesting. The women have these beautiful blankets that are eye-catching wrapped around them in multiple scenes. The attention to detail is remarkable on both the clothing and in the sets. The cast is very good as well especially in the first hour that establishes the relationship between Dicaprio and Gladstone. They have an uneasy chemistry that perfectly captures Ernest and Molly's odd courtship. Their scenes together are both creepy and sometimes endearing. Gladstone brings stoic sensitivity to her character that becomes important to the action of the film. I only wish her decisions made more sense. She's depicted with a lot of strength, but she doesn't seem to have much agency. That was pretty frustrating. I'm not sure how Scorsese could have fixed that in the screenplay or in the performances.On a side note: Someone tell Brendan Fraser that the Academy called to say they want their Oscar back. Just put it outside your front door, and someone will be by to pick it up. It was supposed to be Colin Farrell's anyway.Ultimately, Killers of the Flower Moon is another great movie in Martin Scorsese's filmography. However, you must be prepared to strap in for its excessive runtime, but the movie holds your attention for the most part. This compelling story of an American tragedy is told very well with good performances and great attention to detail but it still feels like some pieces are missing. Just a bowl of popcorn at a matinee - actually, multiple bowls will be necessary to get through this epic.",positive
462,"This had all the pieces of a masterpiece - top notch director, 2 big name seasoned actors, an incredible historical story, authentic and respectful casting - but it ultimately fell flat. I had much higher expectations - I thought it was going to be powerful and moving, placing a spotlight on yet another instance of depravity in American History, but there was zero chemistry between the characters, there was tons of lacking information to explain the motives of the natives, the timeline was seriously muddy making it difficult to understand how much time had passed between events.... I was surprised that with this incredible story, the movie was a dud. And what a travesty to have this story told without an ounce of passion.",positive
463,"I am amazed at how well this story is told by Scorsese. He co-wrote the screenplay and was involved in the story development so a few of his decisions are pretty obvious but overall this film was actually better than I expected it to be. Not really all that heavy with white savior nonsense, but it is plagued with white guilt.Scorsese does a pretty good job of displaying the clash of cultures between the spiritual teachings of the Osage and the savage Capitalism that the white man spreads into every crevice. For a man who seems kind of out of touch, Martin Scorsese definitely understands the injustices perpetrated against entire people and the eradication of cultures and populations in service of the almighty dollar. This is definitely one of the better films in his catalog even if I do have some issues with it.Really there is no reason for these big name directors to make these 3+ hour movies. The film probably could have cut off an hour and still retained its effectiveness. That being said, it is a very well paced movie and time flies by for the most part. Also I do prefer my movies to be more transparent with their politics so that way I seem less pretentious when I talk about the inherent police in all movies, and this film puts the politics of the situation front and center. I largely agree with the sentiments of the film but it still does speak volumes that Scorsese chose to tell this story of the Osage Tribe from the point of view of a white man.Overall a good movie and Scorsese at least doesn't have terrible politics, which is more than I can say for the likes of Nolan. I do want to rewatch this film but the length is going to put that off so it may be a while before I give a more in depth analysis.",positive
464,"We never truly want to see our favorite directors quit. But Killers of the Flower Moon would, as many have noted, make a poetic finale to Martin Scorsese's oeuvre -- particularly the films of his that illuminate the darkest eras of American history. Just as Twin Peaks: The Return seems a fitting end to the full body of work of Lynch and The Kingdom: Exodus to that of Von Trier (although I hope neither is true), this 3.5-hour dirge would be a good ending to Scorsese's. (In particular, a scene right before the ending will show you what I mean.)That said, I'm hopeful he keeps making movies and also speaking out about them. Few filmmakers, especially at his level of fame and notoriety, seem to truly care about the art and craftsmanship of the medium quite like he does. Unsurprisingly, he brings us one of the most expertly crafted films of the year 2023 -- which already contains an unprecedented number of such highlights.Based on the David Grann novel of the same name, Killers of the Flower Moon chronicles the Oklahoma ""Reign of Terror"" where, between 1918 and 1931, more than 60 Osage Native Americans were systematically killed by followers of owl-faced rancher William Hale (played here by Robert De Niro) and his nephew Ernest (Leonardo DiCaprio) after oil was discovered on their land. It is, mildly put, an uncompromising account; DiCaprio portrays what many have called ""the Scorsese protagonist that Scorsese holds the most contempt for"". (You'd think this means the portrayal is obvious enough, but as you'll soon see, there are some detractors who managed to miss the point, the same as both detractors and fanboys of old have missed the point of Travis Bickle, Jordan Belfort, Frank Sheeran, Henry Hill, et al.)Scorsese gets the best performances out of these stars that we've seen in years (I'm yet to mention Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, and Brendan Fraser), but the true standout for many is Lily Gladstone as Mollie Kyle, who watches powerlessly -- and at first unaware of who's responsible -- while her loved ones are murdered in succession. I very much second the praise of this ""new"" actress, whose importance to the narrative is underappreciated by some. A smarter critic than I noted that Scorsese's movies function as a ""timeline of toxic masculinity"" throughout American history, but more broadly than that, his films are about sin; it is fitting that his (maybe) final film would go back to the founding sins, complete with a confession scene where Gladstone gets her finest moment.Interestingly, even though everyone seems to have lost faith in streaming by now, Apple TV+ is looking to be the blessing I thought we were getting with Netflix circa 2019. ""This is everything Netflix wanted to be"", writes Nick Mekanos, ""a place where filmmakers can craft their dream projects, free from established studios, but not lose the theatrical experience"".Killers of the Flower Moon is superb, and even if I would agree that it gets slow at points, there are zero scenes I can think of that could be cut -- that is, without damaging the story. (If you want to cut it up into a miniseries or a bunch of TikToks for the kiddies, fine; just give the rest of us the option to watch it as intended.) This is, like I said, an immaculate and deliberate piece and I should expect we'll be hearing Scorsese, Gladstone, DiCaprio, De Niro, Rodrigo Prieto, Robbie Robertson, and Thelma Schoonmaker's names a lot at next year's Oscar Night, which is shaping up to be the most genuinely intriguing one in forever.And of course, a post like this wouldn't be complete without further thoughts on other people's thoughts. Like Oppenheimer, this film inspired all kinds of Hot Takes, except instead of complaining that the film failed to depict the atrocities caused by its subjects, the Take-makers now whine that it does depict them; that this candid portrayal of the brutality, greed, and just plain evil at the foundation of American capitalism is actually ""exploitation"". What the two films share in common -- in terms of things that their detractors choose to whine about -- is the fact that they ""focus too much"" on the oppressors and the oppressors' vantage point, even though that's part of what makes both movies so powerfully unsettling. (Someone remarked that this film routinely recalls the ""Let's not drop the bomb on Kyoto; my wife and I went on honeymoon there"" moment from Oppenheimer.)Then, of course, there are the people who are still hurt over Scorsese's comments re: comic-book movies (the theme-park-ification of mainstream cinema) and are now so fresh out of straws to grasp that they try to equate a certain cameo in the film (which I won't reveal, but let's just say it has decidedly more depth to it than a ""fun Easter Egg"" and works more as an introspective musing on the person's career and what fans of his choose to focus on vis-a-vis the subject matters he tackles) to your average namedrop in Star Wars or Marvel media. I don't even know where to begin with the Armond White article that calls this ""Scorsese's first political film"".I'm proud that nobody let these ""Hot Takes"" slide, including those in my film circles who might have once said, ""You're so right, this movie DOES need more of Group X"" or ""Yeah, the facile progressivism of Disney is definitely superior to Scorsese's many years of representation and amplifying unheard voices"". As I said in my previous article, the malady of wanting to seem on the right side of some imagined two-sides idpol ""war"" will always come back, but 2023 saw a pretty big change take place.The movies we got to see in the mainstream in 2023 reminded many normies how great cinema can be, and how unwise it is to dismiss great filmmaking simply because it doesn't ""represent"" this or that group in some arbitrarily constructed ""correct way"" (especially when, as we've hopefully also learned, we can seek beyond what we see if we desire a particular viewpoint). Or because it doesn't have Spider-Man in it.",positive
465,"I didnt really hate it or didnt really love it but i need to say it was pretty interesting anyway and its kind of scary to think that its based on real facts and characters : very scary about what people can do for money .We knew from the beginning there was a sort of conspiracy or something really wrong is happening but couldnt say what it was until the first revelation that make us aware that Ernest is linked to these and his uncle too and we really witness during the whole movie their lies ,their plans to earn all the money by killing all these indian womens . I need to say that its not often that indians are in a screen like this and its great to see that and to know more their culture trough that horrible story . And we will also see the repercussions of their acts : how they will also get in trouble by the Washington police and their investigations and slowly they will get all out by justice . A sad and real story that really didnt let me indifferent and yeah this is scary to see how mens can act like this for money . I enjoyed also the end when they make us know what happened to all of them after the events of the movie and that make a logical conclusion. I enjoyed it anyway even if it pretty slow in the structure and take time to developp and make us see whats the movie is all about .Very tragic and horrible but mens will be always mens whatever their colours or beliefs. The complain that i can make is that the movie is a little bit too long and i can feel a little bit bored by the portraits and the events until 1h30 who get way more interesting when the killing begin but its ok . Still can be seen with a great cinematography and landscapes. The story its pretty uneven in the rythm and the interest but its real you know so we watch with curiousity.",positive

468,"Scorsese, a master of his craft, is back in this new picture which boats incredible performances from its star studded cast. Lily Gladstone is the standout here, which is impressive with her playing alongside both DeNiro and DiCaprio. The movie tells the story of greedy men who launch a plot to kill off a bloodline of wealthy Osage women. As far as enjoyability, the film's lengthy runtime most certainly shows itself. With a 3.5 hour length, the film tends to drag. While violent, I honestly could have used longer violent sequences, as the film does a poor job with building suspense. A great story with stellar performances, but I might wait to stream again on Apple TV so I can take a break halfway through.",positive

470,"The movie was an artistic masterpiece - acting, cinematography, sound, costume, and of course incredible story design. You are made to feel what the Osage people feel growing fear and paranoia with eventual hope when the FBI come. It is a powerful portrayal of a really horrible story that shows symptoms of racism and apathy that we are used to see perpetrated on people in poverty but are shocked to see this done to people with means and wealth.The times, just after WW1, were barely 100 years ago but feel like a completely different time with how people decided to marry, socialize, provide rule of law, and more leaving an interesting pull people pure humanism and feelings that these are very different people.",positive
471,"When I was a young boy, it was fashionable to root for the calvary and settlers with their fights against the Indian ""savages"". As I got older and better informed, I began to root for the Indian ""savages"" and against the calvary and settlers. The white man in the Western and Expansion period of the United States was actually the savage. This film highlights that reality very well.Marty Scorsese does another professional job of directing with his meticulous attention to detail. I thought the film was a bit overlong, and could have been cut at least a half hour or so. Theatres do not generally like long-running films like these, as they reduce revenues. The movie reminded me of ""The Gangs of New York"" another DiCaprio miscasting mistake by Scorsese. DiCaprio just wasn't macho enough for that role, and he wasn't young enough to be a returning WW 1 vet in this production. He was a 50 year old playing the average age of a returning vet from that war, which was 25 or less.DiCaprio was good for some roles, such as Catch Me if You Can and Titanic, but not for action or macho roles. DiNero, on the other hand, is a consummate professional and is good at anything he does. He excels as Hale, the unbelievably evil antagonist of the film. Ms Gladstone also gives a stellar performance in this film as the Indian wife of DiCaprio. The rest of the cast, the cinematography, and script are spot on as well. The tragedy of the Osage peoples was a story that needed to be told on the big screen. I recommend it.",positive
472,"The story is historically important. And nearly everything about the film is very good, even very, very good. Oscar's? I wouldn't be surprised. But the filmmaking repeatedly gets in the way of the story and, for me, somewhat becomes a more interesting story to watch as it slowly, slowly eats itself right before your very eyes. I mean, oh sure, we follow the characters, we know both their secrets-and that they'll be revealed. And Leo grabs your attention when on screen (but how much of that is because your eyes are dying for ... anything?). What's the one adage about time passing slowly when you watch a pot boil? And what's the other one about being a frog in a pot of water and slowly dying without realizing it? This film allows you to be the frog, the pot, the water, the stove, and the sink. And you have time for the bathroom.",positive
473,"Killers of the Flower Moon tells the true story of how oil was discovered, in Oklahoma in the 1920s, in land owned by the Osage tribe. Suddenly, the Osage people start getting murdered, one by one. The FBI conducts an investigation to identify the culprits behind these grisly murders.Killers of the Flower Moon is a mind-blowing film. Director Martin Scorsese has given us another masterpiece, this time detailing the scheming, greed & outright villainy of the White man & the unspeakable losses & heartbreak that the Native American people went through. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous. The background score by Robbie Robertson is phenomenal. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is spectacular as Ernest Burkhart. DiCaprio shows us yet again, why he's one of the best & most versatile actors working in Hollywood today. Robert De Niro is outstanding as William Hale. Lily Gladstone is awe-inspiring as Mollie Burkhart. Gladstone deserves an Oscar for her fantastic performance & has a long & bright future ahead of her, in Hollywood. The supporting cast is incredible. Kudos to Apple TV for making the effort to release this film theatrically, worldwide. Despite its mammoth runtime, you won't get bored, even for a second. Killers of the Flower Moon is a must watch, especially on the big screen.

474,"Historical Films are really hard to pull off but this was pulled off flawlessly by Martin Scorsese. It is a lovely allegory and example for the actual Trail of Tears, really nice way to learn a bit of history and examine your real human ethics.This however, is only a mere basic description of this film. Now, here are some reasons why to watch it and why not to watch it:
1. Why you should watch it: Amazing acting and direction
The acting from DiCaprio, De Niro, and Gladstone is incredible. They never get too dramatic, never too morally obvious (no spoilers but DiCaprio shocked me with his performance, I never really knew who to root for), and honestly secretive. The actors literally were pulling the heavy load and the direction was honestly strong and impactful. There were careful and resonating choices on Scorsese's side, and this is probably one of his best films, full stop.2. Why you should not watch it: That style of film is not everyone's cup of tea.If you have watched Scorsese's films, you know that he likes to slowly progress the story. I know this well from Shutter Island, where the suspense and story were drawn out well enough into the final scene to still reveal shocking revelations. Most people are not really accustomed or fans of such slow progression and would rather get most of the story right away by the first or second acts, this is not such a film. If you really don't like slowly progressing stories, walk away.3. Why you should watch it: Historical significance
Without going too much into the story, you should know that this is a historical film and it is about one topic not too discussed. It's a film about the Osage County in Oklahoma in the 1920s, and the way it narrates the bigger story in the degree of a single town is very nice. You don't have to know things about the history of the Osages or the Trail of Tears to get into this film, it explains most of it for you anyway. So, if you're into historical films and learning about the cultures of the US, this is definitely a film to watch.4. Why you shouldn't watch it: Needs a lot of focus and attention
It is a very nice film but to be honest, it was tiring to watch. This is not a criticism for me, because I welcome deep films, but for most this could be a setback. It is 3 hours of slow-paced, hint hunt, step by step story. You have to pay attention to it to get the gist of it, and if you miss some things, you lose track of the progression. If you're not equipped to pay attention and be patient with the storytelling, go watch something lighter.5. Why you should watch it: Nicely executed film
It's not always the story and acting that matters. The effects of the film are adequate for the task, especially for a non-action film. The soundtrack is suspenseful enough. The cinematography is very well created, and the set pieces are time-accurate and quite beautiful. It is not the most beautifully executed film I've seen (especially compared to the set pieces, effects, and cinematography of Shutter Island) but it is beautiful for what it is trying to create. Good job, Martin.I hope this is a good review for these who are not big film buffs like me and don't love the genres as much so that they can get a more simple view to choose whether they want to see it. It is a great film if you're into it but it can be quite hard on people, so choose wisely. Also, let me not forget to mention, this is R rated and contains violence, drug use, and a little bit of romance, so if you're not really equipped to handle this, don't put yourself through that.",positive
475,"Easily, the most compelling part of Killers of the Flower Moon is knowing that it's a true piece of our history. The most disappointing part of the movie is Scorsese's over infatuation with his star actors and his apparent infatuation with a single dimension of human nature -- greed. That's a tired theme in movies generally and Scorsese's movies in particular. Certainly this a story of America's greedy and evil history that needs to be told but the movie continues the disservice to the Osage by merely giving lip service to them as a people and a culture. I haven't read the book yet so I don't know how much source material there is on the Osage but hope there is more there than was in the film. Still, Scorsese is a good story teller and the movie is worth a watch as a reminder.",positive
476,"But a dead slow deliverance by martin scorsese this time. There are some good acting deeds done inbetween, but thats dead and far forgotten due to an overlengthy playtime and a slowrunning plot, and the whole true life story line are completely in absentia of a time line to follow. Because this is historical, biopics, and should by all means be respected as such, a timeline is a simple tool to understand the history, and maybe give even more pain to the gout of ''first nation'' misogyni among the rich wealthy , white oil barons and soforth population at that time (and maybe even today).I appraise some of the verbal soloraids done by mr dicaprio, elsewise its just average stuff thinks the grumpy old man.",positive
477,"I watched the movie on a plane, with subtitles so I could catch every word. When the Native language was spoken, however, I thought that the airline skimped on something but I learned, in the trivia section, that subtitles weren't included on purpose so that we could hear the language purely and that its meaning could be discerned generally by the audience. I titled this almost perfect because of the aforesaid trivia, which revealed that the people on which the 2 main characters were based, played by di Caprio and de Nero, were much younger than the actors who played them. I didn't know this when I was watching the film and would have given it 10 stars if I hadn't read the trivia. Overall, I was captivated and not bored, even during ""quiet"" parts because the plot was so thick that one needed time to absorb the gravity of what was going on. Basically, de Nero's character was like a mafia don, beneficial on one hand and deadly on the other. He and his nephew were complex people, but the whites always won until stopped by the FBI.",positive

Felt like a prisoner in cinema üòÇ only reason I didn't leave is DiCaprio since he is my fave actor of all times. But yeah..Btw,People are gonna be scared to criticize this film because of the cast and all the hype but if I can get to be honest, everyone should imo. It's not a good movie let's be honest.There is no story that makes you intrigued, no story that is fun to follow, povs are boring, characters have plain depth, you don't root for anything and nothing.

Whites continue to commit crimes against the Natives, using historically well-planned administrative loopholes from previous bigoted regimes and complex legal strategies. The lack of access to justice and proper education for these few innocent tribes, who have survived ruthless genocide-praised and used as a source of inspiration by Hitler-is an utter disgrace to those who call themselves ""free."" Yes, free from all ethics and humanity. The europeans have taken everything of value from these people, but they still won't let them catch a break until they are completely wiped out.

I believe people very rarely use the term it's too long very well and this was no different. While I don't believe it was necessarily too long I do think the runtime could have been cut down by about 25 minutes but I can't complain. Certainly was a cinematic masterpiece. Not 1 preformance fell short. The directing as a whole was phenomenal. The portrayal of the native Americans and how they were being killed off was great and I'm glad light is being shined on this part of history. Not scorseses best but definitely one of them.

485,"Killers of the Flower Moon.When oil is discovered in 1920s Oklahoma under Osage Nation land, the Osage people are murdered one by one - until the FBI steps in to unravel the mystery.I know it's a very long movie, but C'mon it's Martin Scorsese's, we don't get his movies quite a lot lately and the man is 81 years old damn it, still doing it better than anyone out there.However, I don't think the film needed to be that long Marty.Killers of the Flower Moon is a movie that takes his time of course it does, it's a 3 and a half hour long movie damn it, I won't complain again .Alright, yes The movie is long but for a reason, it tried to not just tell a story but to present a whole culture to the audience through the film's minutes which was great especially with the way he did it, with those oil shots at first and the Osage language and all the details about that interesting culture .Moving now to the main story, which is as interesting as what I've just mentioned, a series of murders of the Osage people created a great mystery that kept me invested, the romantic relationship was beautiful, what a good couple that is, Leonardo and Lilly.What great performances those were !I don't think I've seen a better performance than Lilly Gladstone's and I haven't seen a lot of better performances than Leonardo Dicaprio's either.So yes, here I'm saying that Leo got snubbed in the Oscar nominations, I see him arguably in the top 3 this year alongside Cillian and Paul.I almost forgot to mention that Deniro was insane in this one, he totally deserves his nomination.Killers of the Flower Moon is undoubtedly one of this year's best.",positive

Of course, I'd watched it full, and expected something big, rather collosal. But it turned out to be not as good as my expectations were. The worst thing about the film is play of DiCaprio. His look, his behaviour. Oh, that was painful to watch. Awfull. Sorry) , but it's true.As a conclusion i wanna add, that Killers of Flower Moon is almost a masterpiece. Except some details, the film is really good.",positive
487,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a masterpiece of filmmaking from Martin Scorsese, who delivers a gripping and epic tale of greed, murder, and justice in 1920s Oklahoma. Based on the true story of the Osage Nation, who became rich after oil was discovered on their land, the film explores the dark and violent history of how they were systematically killed by a corrupt local regime, and how the newly formed FBI intervened to solve the mystery.The film boasts an impressive cast, led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, who give stellar performances as the main characters involved in the plot. DiCaprio plays Ernest Burkhart, a white man who marries Mollie Burkhart, an Osage woman played by Gladstone, and becomes entangled in the scheme of his uncle, William Hale, played by De Niro, who is the mastermind behind the killings. Gladstone is a revelation as Mollie, who struggles to cope with the loss of her family and the betrayal of her husband, while also trying to preserve her culture and identity. De Niro is chilling as Hale, who is ruthless, charismatic, and manipulative, and who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.The film is visually stunning, with cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto that captures the beauty and harshness of the landscape, and the contrast between the lavish and the poor. The film also features a haunting score by Robbie Robertson, who died shortly before the film's release, and to whom the film is dedicated. The film is edited by Thelma Schoonmaker, who skillfully balances the multiple timelines and perspectives of the story, and creates a sense of tension and suspense throughout.The film is not without its flaws, however. The film is very long, running for over three hours, and some scenes feel unnecessary or repetitive. The film also suffers from some historical inaccuracies and simplifications, such as portraying the FBI as the heroes, while ignoring the role of the Osage themselves in fighting for their rights and exposing the corruption. The film also has some issues with representation and authenticity, such as casting non-Osage actors to play Osage roles, and using English subtitles instead of Osage dialogue.Overall, Killers of the Flower Moon is a powerful and compelling film that sheds light on a forgotten and tragic chapter of American history, and showcases the talents of Scorsese and his collaborators. The film is a must-watch for fans of Scorsese, DiCaprio, and De Niro, and for anyone who enjoys a good crime drama with a historical twist.",positive
488,"Many years back, I've heard about the Osage Indian murder. The killing for oil land. Never they made a movie on Osage killing. I've no idea they've shown the film correctly but it's way more interesting to keep on eye. But negative movie is way to length - 3 hours and 23 minutes is to lengthy for a murder investigation thriller. I finished watching in 2 days cause of length and my free time. Most importantly, Leonardo did his part very well. I could say the best actor for thriller or crime films.Highly recommended for those who love western/crime/thriller films. Not recommended for family audiences.",positive
489,"Like many people are saying, this movie is way to long, but I'd like to start with what was the most obviously problematic issue for the movie - that it seeks to shed light on the largely unknown exploitation and murder of Osage people at the hands of white criminals, but tells that story almost entirely through the eyes of the white victimizers. That Scorsese chose to let the white villains be the focus rather than have the Osage tell the story from their perspective is a total head scratcher given that the only characters that are fleshed out in the book are the Federal investigators. I know Scorsese likes to explore the dark side of human nature, but DiCaprio and De Niro's characters are so one dimensional that the audience learns everything they need to know about them in the first 30 minutes. It's not as if Scorsese and Roth had anything meaningful to say about the human condition that would justify the choice of perspective. In the 3 1/2 hours of film, the Osage are largely silent and invisible, except as foils to the main characters' schemes.Lily Gladstone's acting is solid and is the only notable performance in the film. She commands attention with her expressions, even though her lines are economical. De Niro (love him though I do) has been playing pretty much the same character since Meet the Parents. His performance in this movie is pulled straight from the same well. Here though, as you might expect, it is completely out of place when he serves up that series of screwball faces and goofy delivery we all know so well. When De Niro and DiCaprio share the screen things don't get much better. They often and riff off of each other, and their repetitive unscripted banter is more open mic night at the improv than serious acting. And at times their buffoonish banter leant the movie a strangely comedic tone, which was jarring given the gravity of the subject. I'm all for a bit of levity, but it made no sense here and just seemed like Scorsese let De Niro be De Niro. I often found myself shaking my head, rolling my eyes, and muttering ""just shut up"" when the two of them were alone chewing up the screen. With minimal character development, a lack of tension in the plot and awkward edits, those three and a half hours sure are a lot to handle.Also disappointing was that Scorsese chose to focus almost entirely on the murders, without giving a fuller accounting of the breadth and scale of the exploitation. Two major issues were addressed briefly, but I would expect that many in the audience who hadn't read the book wouldn't feel their weight or even understand their import. One was that, despite a murder count that many estimate to be in the hundreds, local police did not arrest or convict a single perpetrator before the events that take place in the film. The audience gets little sense of he climate or the perspective of the Osage as to what is happening to their community. The second is that the Osage had to ""prove"" financial competency in order to have control of their own money. Since the arbiters of competency were white, most Osage were forced to have a white ""guardian"" who doled out money at his whim. This led to a local criminal network who overcharged, skimmed, and stole from the Osage for decades. There was so much interesting material that would have made for a much more compelling story, but Scorsese ignored or glossed over them.All in all this was a huge missed opportunity - and a bad film to boot. I don't think it's a requirement for a writer or director to come from the culture they are depicting, but this is a perfect example of how a lack of perspective can spoil an important story. Vintage Spike Lee might have given a story like this life, but Scorsese was clearly not up to the task here. On the tails of Reservation Dogs, which was such a delightful and thoughtful exploration of Native American life, this movie failed to deliver anything more than a standard Hollywood take of events.",positive
490,"Another great film by one of the best directors in history, Mr. Scorsese.It has his stamp, his characteristic stamp that for some may be simple but he does it so well that it is even better than complex plots that never end up fulfilling.That Scorsese continues to make movies is a breath of fresh air in today's monotonous industry.Moving on to the performances, what about Leonardo DiCaprio? For me the best of his generation, underrated by many people, for me he is undoubtedly the Marlon Brando of this century.What about Robert De Niro? Another great of history, he is a living legend and I still believe he can give us more memorable performances.Highly recommended movie, if you like long movies and have time to watch them.",positive

The acting is outstanding, the story plot is heartbreaking, the scenery is breathtaking. And needless to say Scorsese's artistry is at its best. People nowadays want quick reads, quick food, quick shows, quick everything so it's a relief to see that someone is actually taking their time to provide a quality product. A product that will no doubt be seen in decades to come as a work of art that helped give light to a dark moment in American history. Looking forward to Scorsese's next extra-long feature...",positive
492,"...bad execution.This movie could have been an hour shorter and told a better story.I like the premise for the movie, but it drags on far too long. I don't mind an epic-length film, but KOTFM didn't use its very lengthy runtime properly. I didn't know (or remember) most of the people that were killed. Therefore, I didn't have an emotional stake in their fate. After a short period, I thought, ""Oh, here's another unfortunate person that was killed. OK. Moving on.""I barely remembered the names of the major characters in the film. I had no investment in the majority of the cast. For nearly a 3 1/2 hour movie, that is inexcusable.For me, the movie didn't really become interesting until the FBI (or technically BI) came to investigate the murders.Overall, the story had a lot of potential, but the film did not do the story any favors.",positive

Fantastic production, a captivating script, despite the 3 hours and a bit (which I always watch at a fast speed to keep up with my pace), the film flows beautifully, and we don't even realize its long duration...

This made absolutely no sense to me - why not use the time you have for the rest of the story? The history and true story behind this movie is so significant and tragic - and that's what made it a good movie, but I just wish it was told in a way that was more enthralling.",positive
495,"David Grann's novel should be an Oklahoma school history staple. Famed Martin Scorsese directs this much hyped film with a standout cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro. Set in in 1920's Oklahoma and referred to as the Reign of Terror, depiction of serial murders of oil-rich peoples of the Osage Indian Nation.Appalling and inhuman, the Osage people were driven from their lands in Kansas and put upon rocky northern Oklahoma that would later become immensely rich in oil deposits. The more wealthy the native peoples became, the mineral rights became subject of greed and jealousy. Graft and chicanery steadily ran rampant. Small pieces of land were purchased and wealthy Osage women were being married by white men.Things got worse as the wealthy Osage were poisoned, shot and blown to bits as they slept in their homes. These crimes became a vivid stain on humanity and such an embarrassment, the murders were to be investigated by Texas Rangers and a very young F. B. I.This instant epic earned an R rating and runs almost 3 1/2 hours long. The diversified cast also includes: Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, Pat Healy, Barry Corbin, Jillian Dion, Sturgill Simpson, Yancey Red Corn, Jack White and Pete Yorn.",positive
496,"It must be mentioned this movie is somewhat one of the more difficult films to understand. When I went to watch this film in theaters, a large amount of the audience ended up leaving in the 3rd hour. Even I must admit I ended up starving in the 3rd hour but still stayed to the end.It has been a while since I watched a movie this long. I have to state I am not familliar with the creator of this movie or any previous works. I am only speaking on behalf of this movie alone.So the length of this movie is its biggest strength and questionable flaw. Think of doubled edged sword that can hurt you regardless of the angle you hold it.The development and buildup was very slow, the pacing was vastly different and scattered, the mysterious hints and cues were visible.It was interesting, to watch a movie that required you to pay twice as much attention to truly understand. Maybe that's how it was meant to be created?My only issue is naturally the pacing, 3 hours and 30 minutes is a long time. This kind of story could of been compressed in one hour less.

497,"When I saw trailers for this film, I was intrigued and really wanted to see it. It is a powerful and important story but at 3 hours and 26 minutes, it was just entirely too long and drawn out with unnecessary elements. I went to a 12 o'clock noon showing and kept dozing off and there was a gentleman one row in front of me (there were only two of us in the theater) and he actually kept standing up; I assume to keep from falling asleep as well. I'm sure this film will be nominated for several awards, but editing should not be one of them because they could've made it a lot shorter than it was and still told the story. Wait for it to come out in Redbox or streaming; at least that way you can restart if you fall asleep.",positive
498,"I quite enjoyed Killers Of The Flower Moon but have to say that the best thing about it is the flamboyant title. That makes it sound so exotic and exciting but, in effect, it's just long and drawn out, unnecessarily.All I knew was that Osage women were being murdered mysteriously way back in the 1920's. That was enough to make me curious, coupled with the hype around Lily Gladstone's performance. I'm sorry to say, I do not see her performance as an Oscar winner as she doesn't really have a lot to do, other than act sickly and much of that in bed.The two leads on the other hand, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert De Niro were quite riveting for me. Looking grim throughout, Dicaprio, occasionally bursts into a grin when he says how much he loves money. This should be the clue as to the motive of murder which ensues. We don't really get to know until a while into the film though, who the real villain is so I can't say.Although it is a fine movie, Scorsese has made it into something that is similar to a TV series like Boardwalk Empire, and that was more exciting. This film rather plays to a one trick pony theme by repeating itself, time and again. People of the Osage tribe are murdered, people who were lucky (or unlucky enough) to strike oil and become wealthy native Americans, at a time when great prejudice was rampant. It has that feeling of the old saying that ""the only good Indian is a dead indian"". That may shock some people today but that was the attitude back then amongst many white people.This film needed a sharper editor and more scenes to shock the viewer into the horror of what was occurring. There is a scene where a young woman is ruthlessly gunned down that shocks but that is not enough in a movie that runs for three and a half hours nearly. I watched on Apple +TV in two parts.Perhaps we could have a director's cut editing it down to two hours or less and we might find a great movie there.",positive
499,"I haven't fallen asleep during a film since Benjamin Button, but this was bad. There was no need for this to be even close to 2 hours! Brendan Fraser's limited acting was a joke, and DeNiro did his best DeNiro impression.The film was basically the same repetitive plot over the span of 3 hours and 20 minutes, one family member or tribe member being murdered after the next. Then a trial which we already knew the outcome of. The ending was the strangest cringeworthy finish I've seen in quite some time, with a cute cameo visit by Scorsese himself.This was a shame since I'm a fan of Scorsese's work in the past, but this was unbearable.",positive
500,"It is not the place of movies to give you history lessons, and when that style of film is attempted in a ham fisted way it comes of as saccharine or politically motivated. This movie is neither. It instead gives an unflinching look into the areas of our collective history we are too keen to forget.The pacing of this, over 3 hour, epic is one of it's best features, though if I would have watched this in a classic theatre setting an intermission would have been nice, since I would have been mad that I missed parts in order to go to the restroom, even if they are unfashionable in this era of film making.The unglamorous violence is properly disturbing and unsettling and places the vile-ness right in front of you without reveling on it's practical effects.It even becomes self aware of some of the more problematic aspects of profiting off of this type of tragedy, namely white storytellers selling tragedy of native populations without arriving at a conclusion. It feels like Scorsese feels conflicted without becoming preachy about telling this important story and understanding how it can be problematic.It is not his best work, but it is in his top 3.It truly deserves Best Picture of 2023 and stands out as authentic in a field of it's overblown and over-hyped competition (looking at you Barbie & Oppenheimer).",positive
501,"Most Natives of the American continent died fighting, others surrendered to the enemy, Paleface, lost pride and dignity and with whiskey and candy bars, their reason, for refined sugar and alcohol corrupts the body and the spirit and turns a man into a weakling stooge. The Osage surrendered, then bought their land on-paper from the U. S. Government and were blessed and cursed to discover that petroleum was hiding under their feet; then powerful white folk conspired against them, to first kill them, and then get their bloody hands upon their behemothly abundant wealth. I already knew the story of the Osage murders and the origin of F. B. I. From having seen a couple of documentaries on the subject months ago, when the first teaser for the ""New Movie By Martin Scorsese!!!"" dropped. Did I educate myself a bit more from watching the ""New Movie By Martin Scorsese???"" No sir, very sadly so, but I must admit that I didn't have a great time sitting through it. Godard once criticized a Times magazine cover where Jane Fonda was depicted looking sad in Vietnam for the unfortunate casualties of war: ""Press your eyebrows together a little more, Jane,.. give us this familiar, skeptical expression all the ancient Greek philosophers must've had in their faces; an expression we know from your father in ""12 Angry Men"", and we'll believe with all our hearts that you're devastated for the poor casualties' hardships!.."" No matter how brutal, yet-true. I thought of his criticism while watching DiCaprio and DeNiro sharing a scene: ""Press your lips together, extend your jaws-perfect! We believe everything you say now!"" The problem: it's been done a thousand times before, we've seen them doing it a thousand times before, and we both (those up the screen and we, the mortals) are tired at last. I had the feeling I was watching ""Goodfellas"" for the 100th time; Scorsese is one of the two best directors of history. This is sober judgment, not taste. In his case, his neurotic quickness and strictly professional approach to his material has abstracted all the magic of the art; 'drama' has become chewing gum, like in the tongue of Oliver Stone. I'm a dramatist, I dramatize and now I'monna make a drama.. and another one.. and another one.. this next one's bigger.. more money.. more names.. now all big names put together.. now more names and more money.. Even though for a long time now I agreed with Werner Herzog's assessment on Martin Scorsese, I wouldn't dare, until this evening, say it out loud; ""I find mr. Scorsese to be very cowardly when it comes to visual storytelling...""
Also, there was too much talk circulating about how this isn't yet another ""white savior"" story, nevertheless, I dare ask, who would save poor Molly (Lily Gladstone) and who knows how many other Osage people, hadn't the Federal Bureau's investigator (Jesse Plemons) showed up?.. Anyway, all I'll remember from ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" will be DiCaprio's and DeNiro's grimaces.",positive

And for the movie itself, I have to say Scorsese has outdone himself. I already knew he wouldn't disappoint and this movie was everything I hoped for ..and more. The ending was insane and you could really tell how much this story being told meant to him. Everyone please go see this. Ignore the idiots complaining about the runtime.

503,"""I realized I was making a movie about all the white guys.""For those who haven't heard this quote a billion times, like I have, Scorsese was referring to how his realization that Killers of the Flower Moon (which I'll refer to as Killers from here on out) was being told ""from the outside in"" prompted him to extensively rewrite the script in an attempt to shift the perspective to one more suited to properly show the inner workings of the place and its inhabitants and, what I was perhaps most excited to see, the Osage culture, one that I knew absolutely nothing about. That perspective shift in question was from the FBI investigator (now a side character played by Jesse Plemons) to Ernest. Before finally getting to see the film, I heard from tons of people, both online and in my personal circles, that this shift wasn't enough and Mollie (or the Osage in general) instead should've been the main character. At first, I was willing to defend the choice of Ernest: in a tale so unambivalently black-and-white morally speaking, placing a character that treads in the grey as the lead can be of tremendous benefit to a story. Schindler's List would already do the job of being a confronting work without Schindler, but with him as the central perspective you get an idea of how both sides are situated, a great help in understanding the bigger picture. The Jews are still clearly the helpless victims and the nazi's are nazi's, but there is a key player in the midst that is allowed a change, an arc. Killers could have reaped these benefits as well, but it makes a crucial error: Ernest isn't morally grey. He isn't walking the line in between as you watch in anticipation what side he'll eventually topple towards. From the first moment onwards, he's plain evil. Maybe not as much as Hale, but it doesn't take being Hitler to classify as a nazi. The only redeemable quality he possesses is his love for Mollie, and even then you could point towards the ulterial motive he very well may have to marry her. As he very literally states, he just loves money. You may ask why exactly this is an issue, and I can provide you at least two reasons.Firstly, this saps out any and all tension that could have very well been present. Ernest is not only familiar with the inner workings of his uncle's 'imperium', he operates directly in it. Hell, his exortations and crimes get more screentime than Hale's. This means that from the word go, we are fully aware of what's going on, who's doing it and why. All our questions are already answered, and what we get to watch for the majority of the runtime is these white men planning and executing their plans and executions. Sometimes with a little pushback, or a slight complication, but mostly without signficiant faults and consequences. This could've been solved not only by changing Ernest's position in the system, but also if the perspective had been the FBI investigator or the Osage. Now, I'm not saying this should've had a detective angle with some twist or whatever -- anyone with more than two braincells can figure out exactly what is happening at the very least fairly quickly -- however, without any blind spots there nothing to discover and thus, ultimately, a lack of engagement with the audience. Not going to exclaim this thing is boring though, Scorsese luckily keeps it moving throughout the runtime (which he surprisingly always manages to do, no matter the length) but you can definitely feel there's something missing in that first half.Somewhat ironically, following Ernest also means that 'white guys' approach Scorsese was so keen on avoiding is, albeit not in full force, very much present. It's like the new version of the script was somehow lost and those Osage viewpoints and aspects had to be crammed into that pre-realization script to meet the deadline, and what was left of that Osage angle was reduced to mere touches, an afterthought. The opening scene where the pipe is buried and the oil spews out of the ground made me really excited to see what these natives had in store for us, but there's almost none of that anywhere else. You get DiCaprio reading a book about them out loud, regurgitating first-chapter information like you're listening to a Wikipedia page. By the end, I felt like I had not only learned hardly anything about the Osage besides what they call the sun, but barely seen them on screen too. If you were to construct a Bechdel test for the Osage, I doubt that this film would pass.It's unlikely Scorsese is aware of that, however, his efforts and the undeniable passion he has expressed towards bringing these people to the big screen is admirable to say the least. I think the remark that he stepped outside of his comfort zone is a little unearned, but the fact that he tried (at 80 years old!) is still commendable, and the insane budgets he now receives to continue to explore the art of film has me thinking I'm not the only one to prize him on those kinds of things.That being said, I don't think he really elevates the material with the form. The production design, cinematography and performances do the heavy lifting. Not saying Scorsese should've pulled a Cape Fear and thrown the camera around, but aside from the occasional whip pan or somewhat lengthy (tracking) shot, he more often than not resides in the comfort of shot-reverse shot conversations, not changing the angles for minutes on end. At times, this directs your attention to the performances, yet for the most part it's nothing more than a dull bit of filmmaking. Best example is in one of the first scenes: in one shot, Ernest approaches his uncle's house, greets the people there, talks a bit, and then enters the house -- this clearly required some planning in terms of blocking and framing. What follows is DiCaprio and De Niro sitting statically in a chair for 5 minutes with barely any other footage than camera A/B over-the-shoulder.It does take a very abrupt yet interesting turn in the last couple of minutes, where a sort of Wes Anderson frame narrative is introduced, a neat way to replace the 'cards on the screen filling you in on what happened after' method. Scorsese himself takes centre stage to speak the final few words of the film -- very fitting for what is thought to perhaps be his last production. And I must say, in spite of all the critiques I've been listing, this would be a solid goodbye. Yes, this is the part where after 1000+ words of rambling on about what I disliked, I come out in the last paragraph to explain that actually, there was a ton that I loved. As I mentioned, the technical elements shine, Prieto makes the whole thing look stunning, and for a 200-minute picture, this never grows dull, even with the aforementioned lack of tension in the first half. Besides, what follows addresses many of the problems I found, like introducing actual suspensefulness that gradually builds. Not to mention, the leads get to really work their way towards those acting nominations, with no doubt in my mind that wins are imminent. Best Picture is also not a question of if, but when, and if Killers ends up taking that one home, I don't see myself getting upset in the slightest. A flawed achievement.",positive
504,"Beautiful cinematography, masterful editing and the three leads - Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro - all deserve awards. They thought The Irishman would drag, I might feel the same way here, but I think it earned almost every minute of its 3.5 hour running time.Complaint? DiCaprio contorts his face like a bulldog throughout the entire movie - I only noticed about 2.5 hours in, but I can't shake the image. It's still a great performance, and the character he portrays here is unlike any other character he's ever played. There's also a creeping familiarity to parts of the final act, but some interesting twists are made. And then... the end of the final scene and then the final shot are both brilliant and help end the film on a powerful note. That being said, I expect the final scene to be divisive. Well, I think.",positive
505,"The story takes place in the 1920s around the Osage Indian tribe living in Oklahoma. Native Americans are being killed one by one after the tribe becomes rich by discovering oil. The Osage massacre attracts the attention of the FBI, which begins an investigation.I was looking forward to this as I love an epic story. This was a subject I knew nothing about too, so I was madly interested.In terms of s story it did what stories are supposed to do: it told a tale of what went on and laid bare the greed and inhumanity of humans. A tale as old as stories. It was a great story and I am glad I know it.However, the greatest stories should be told in the greatest way, and this wasn't necessarily the greatest telling. Robert DeNiro was Robert DeNiro, as he always is. He only ever plays himself. On the other hand Leo DiCaprio stood out as he plays a character and he does it very well mostly. The cast was mostly good if not great, but it was overly stagnant at times and you felt the story was shuffling to a halt. That would be my only criticism really.Look at the TV show 1883. That's how to draw out an epic saga and never leave your audience bored. Scorsese lost his touch on this one sadly but that didn't mean it was a poor film, it just wasn't a great one.",positive
506,"It's fascinating to me at least how director Martin Scorsese's approach to 'death' has significantly evolved in the last few years; noticeably from Silence in 2016 to The Irishman just 3 years later, and now in Killers of the Flower Moon; where his works seem to indulge a colder yet personal and mature tone of acceptance towards death. Death is not as grand or showy as in his earlier works (think Goodfellas or Taxi Driver), but is more unforgiving and ever looming.Killers of the Flower Moon is not an easy movie to recommend. It just might not be everyone's cup of tea. For starters, it's easy to be intimidated by its gargantuan 210-minute runtime, at least I know I was (and that too catching the 9:30pm show), but it surprisingly felt adequate and compelling enough to earn it. The narration too is more direct; where the trading in of the story's potential suspense and action for a more festering and corrupting tale of greed and odiousness might again, not be for everyone to enjoy. Actually, (and pardon my possible pretentiousness, I honestly do not mean for it to be as such, but) it's not a movie you can go into with any expectations to ""enjoy"". Its more a movie of reflection whose enjoyment and value of entertainment comes from its masterful handling and communicating of its themes and motifs.Now onto the actual movie itself. I enjoyed it a lot. I felt like my expectations were met and I walked out the cinema feeling satisfied with what I had watched. I enjoyed everything about this movie; from its face to its technical detail, but it would be criminal to not point out the obvious draw; that being the amazing performances of actors DiCaprio, De Niro and the extraordinary Lily Gladstone who served as the movie's spiritual anchor. And much credit to director Scorsese; who for a man with nothing left to prove, proves yet again his thorough understanding of the cinematic medium.In conclusion, I could see it being a divisive movie and I am strangely okay with that. You could tell me you hated it, and I'd not think much of it. Like I've said a couple times already, it's not for everyone, it doesn't seem to be intended for everyone. I liked it, and if you want to give this movie a chance to see if you might like it too, please do.",positive
507,"No, I'm not trying to support a criminal tyrant such as Donald Trump with this review title. However, there is still a relation between the madman's senseless post and Martin Scorsese's new blockbuster. While Donald Trump is posting nonsense online time and again, Killers of the Flower Moon is filled with endless dialogues going nowhere that are going to exhaust even the most patient audience as well. This movie is at least ninety minutes too long and would work much better with a more concise cut.That's not the first time Martin Scorsese makes the exact same mistake. The Irishman was a promising gangster movie watered down by its excessive length and tiring dialogues as well. Here's a general problem with established directors such as Scorsese, Nolan, Cameron and the likes. Once they have reached a certain level of success, they are allowed to do anything they want without studio executives interfering much. One might think that this freedom will lead to splendid results but in many cases, it leads to directors becoming arrogant, megalomaniac and self-centered. Artistic freedom turns out to be a poisoned gift.This is really a shame in the case of Killers of the Flower Moon. The story has much depth to offer. The characters are profound and offer much development. The subject of racism towards First Nations has become more relevant than ever before. This movie really is on the pulse of time. Needless to say that I particularly care about such subjects and can highly recommend films like Indian Horse and The Grizzlies.Some elements of this movie are very decent. The settings have been created with much detail and bring to life Oklahoma's Osage reservation in the early twentieth century. The camera and lighting techniques are used efficiently throughout the movie and add much atmospheric depth to the story. The acting performances are overall decent, with Lily Gladstone being the strongest actress in the movie, portraying a proud First Nations woman who is losing her mother and her sisters while confronting danger and treachery on a daily basis. The way this movie incorporates clothings, festivities and music of the Osage Nation is very detailed, inspiring and respectful.Still, Killers of the Flower Moon is hard to sit through despite its talented cast, humble intentions and detailed work. If you care about First Nations issues, you should watch movies such as Indian Horse and The Grizzlies instead. Martin Scorsese should aim to make a much shorter movie next time and get help in the screenwriting department.",positive
508,"It's an epic didactic historical drama set from 1918 to 1929 in Osage County, Oklahoma. It follows the murders of members of the Osage Nation by a white criminal family over a number of years in the 1920s and the investigation carried out by the Bureau of Investigation (later named FBI).Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an uneducated World War I hero who shows up in Gray Horse, Oklahoma in 1918 seeking work from his uncle, William King Hale (Robert De Niro), a prominent local businessman and self-described friend to the Osage Nation. Ernest cannot undertake heavy work because of war injuries, so becomes a taxi driver. Ernest's brother, Byron (Scott Shepherd) is part of Hale's business. Because of Osage Nation individually allocated ""headrights"" to income from oil discovered on their reserve, members of the nation are wealthy. However, it is possible for the headright to pass to non-Osage persons through marriage if the Osage person dies.Ernest is attracted to Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a full-blood Osage woman; they then marry. Byron is married to Mollie's sister, Anna (Cara Jade Myers). Gradually deaths within Mollie's family occur within a short period of time--some from illness and some from murder. There are also other suspicious deaths within the Osage Nation. The Bureau of Investigation's work is led by Tom White (Jesse Plemons).""Killers of the Flower Moon"" follows events related to Hale, his nephews, and other persons employed by Hale. It introduces us to numerous Osage traditions and takes its time unfolding the story. The main characters are all based on historical figures, though the film takes great license in playing out events and creating dialogue. The viewer needs some endurance for this 3 1/2 hour movie that could have been at least 1/2 hour shorter and a bit less heavy-handed. Nonetheless, De Niro, DiCaprio, and Gladstone are all excellent.I wish it had been R-rated to keep teenagers out of the theater; there was a row of constant chatter that finally left before the film ended. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" does benefit from a wide screen. The wide spaces of Oklahoma are beautifully shown. However, eventually watching on the home screen would allow breaking the movie into two sessions.",positive
509,"This is a lovely 2 hour story told in 3 hours 15 minutes by stretching out every shot, depicting the same thing over and over again, and including extraneous scenes. I guess he got seduced by the success of ""The Irishman"" to thinking that he could do another epic mobster film just moving the setting from NY to OK.All the lovely acting (by the Osage characters...not DiCapprio who played a one-note angst-ridden dullard throughout) and cinematography was not enough to keep me awake for the entire evening of trying to watch this thing. Definitely the most clumsy of all of Scorsese's mobster films (no character arcs, unclear character motivations, weird plot points, unclear point of the whole thing), but I guess he thought that the halo effect of being a docudrama depicting an historical injustice would buy him slack on the standard of quality.",positive
510,"Wow, was I disappointed. Yes, there's some solid acting here, but the story just isn't all that interesting. It's way too long, it's been promoted far too much by the media, and I hate to say it, but the movie is boring. It's one of the only movies I've been in for a long time where my butt started to ache in the theater seat despite the fact that big stars were on the screen in front of me. I'm sorry, but I just don't ""get"" the acclaim here. Take Marty out of the picture and give this credit to an unknown director and it would have been an ""also ran."" If this thing shows up at the Academy Awards with a bunch of wins, I'm going to toss my TV out the window. Let's call it here folks . . . This thing comes darn close to being labled a complete stinker.",positive
511,"The strongest aspect of Scorsese's films is that they have a perfect story and tell this story fluently, almost to perfection. This feature is not lost in this movie either. The story of the local people getting rich from oil, and the foreigners pursuing the wealth here, slowly harming the local people is very striking. I finished it in one go. Perfect. Although it is very sad to see Robert De Niro getting older, it is happy to still be able to watch him on the screens. Dicaprio is good as always, but there is no extra. Lily Gladstone gave a great performance. I am eagerly waiting for the new movie of the great master Scorsese.",positive
512,Yes it's long yes there's a lot of dialogue but it's a really beautiful film once again from the great MS. Listen people just watch it. Don't be turned off by the negative reviews. We all know that this director only does really good movies and this is one of them. Leo is brilliant the actress who plays his wife is sublime the stellar support cast are quality. Just make sure you're in the mood for a movie when you watch this 'cause it's over 3 hrs long. How a director like MS continues to direct such lovely work consistently for decades blows my mind and this is one of them. Watch it don't hesitate ðŸ˜ƒ,positive
513,"This is indeed another masterpiece by the Director despite the sniping from the sidelines which I believe have more to do with professional rivalry than genuine concerns from SOME directions regarding historical accuracy. If Robert De Nero doesn't win an Oscar for a spellbounding performance then there is something wrong . His alleged "" pupil "" Di Caprio has finally completed the transition from a "" pretty face "" which he began with "" The Revenant "" , sidestepped with a couple of lightweight movies but has now completed his metamorphosis into a mature truly talented actor . As always , a solid supporting cast of great talent mixed with little know cast members round off another stellar movie .",positive
514,"First and foremost: this is a movie well directed, written, acted, filmed. It emanates passion and love for cinema, and these days to me these are the most important achievements of a movie.Gladstone, DiCaprio and DeNiro all delivered solid performances.I have 2 big problems:
Runtime: I have never in my life looked for the time when I was liking what I was watching. This time after 2h40m I was tired and looking for an escape. If a movie is 4 hours long with a plot that covers 4 hours I have no problem. Here the story ends 1 hour before the movie. It could have been shorter for sure.Stupidity: I don't know the story so I speak for what I saw. There were some moments where I felt kinda out of the story because of the absurdity in a bad sense of what I was seeing. How could Mollie not even suspect of Ernest and William after the death of her entire family, after the worsening of her health? Love? Blindness? Just stop injecting that liquid! DeNiro here is more of a comedian with his faces, mouth movements, words and so on. I could not take him seriously as a villain for a single moment. But this is how he was directed so maybe it's me.",positive
515,"The true story of what was done to the Osage is tragic, riveting, and important. The movie told it very well, although I can see that the film somewhat centered the white characters too much at the expense of the Osage characters, whose tragedy it was.Lily Gladstone is magnificent. Leonardo D is very good. (I don't know why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar.) DeNiro always gets the job done but it's kind of funny that he's just a few years younger than his real-life character was when he died after a long stretch in prison. (Actually, I think Leonardo and Deniro are both about twice the ages of their real-life counterparts when the actual murders took place.)I liked that they didn't include the whole story of the founding of the FBI, which the book went into at great and somewhat boring length and so detracted from the Osage story, I felt. On the other hand, the film may have cut that part too much, and maybe could have spent a little more time on Plemon's character figuring things out. It's just kind of a done deal when he shows up.It feels kind of anticlimactic at the end, but that's likely because it's a true story. I'm glad Scorcese didn't invent a big bang fake ending.I loved the surprise at the beginning. That was really cool.I know some reviewers have trouble with the length - and it is, indeed, long. I think it worked because you realize that Ernest went along with what was done to Mollie for a very long time - and she was suffering all that time. It also allowed viewers' dread to build up. Full disclosure, I watched it in two sittings - it's not a movie to start later at night unless you want to be up till the wee hours.",positive
516,"The movie is certainly eye opening. For someone who doesn't know much about the Native American history, it was gut wrenching to see how the various tribes were exploited.It takes something special to ignore such brutality & injustice & the movie shows this really well. However, the problem lies with how boring the screenplay is. A person next to me in the theater dozed off for 15 mins & realized that they didn't really miss anything. The legal drama towards the end too is very basic & really not intriguing.I must say though that the acting is top notch. Leo is fantastic but Lily Gladstone steals the show. A tighter screenplay with some decent editing would've opened this movie to a wider audience rather than just the cinephiles.",positive
517,"In Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" a scene depicts men working in a lake of fire, resembling Boschian imps. This apocalyptic image is fitting for the story of love, murder, greed, and betrayal in 1920s Indian Country. Scorsese's true-crime epic, with grace, sorrow, and filmmaking clarity, has turned into a requiem for the country, showcasing the horrors of human nature. Scorsese's book, set on the Osage Reservation in northern Oklahoma, recounts a history of violence as bloody as the United States itself. The crimes, primarily tracing back to 1921, involved the murder of several dozen Osage, some killed by shooting, others by blowing up, and others dying from an enigmatic wasting illness. The era is often referred to as the Osage Reign of Terror, which incorrectly implies the Osage were responsible for the horrors. Scorsese's film, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is a big, bigger-than-life story with sweeping vistas and soaring camerawork. The film shifts from bright, wide-open spaces to shadowy interiors, capturing the richly populated cast. Ernest Burkhart, a war veteran, is engrossed in a Hobbesian churn of humanity, feeling both energized and bewildered. The film is a big, bigger-than-life movie with sweeping vistas and soaring camerawork, blending bright and dark interiors. Scorsese's work is characterized by its expressiveness in both filmmaking and subjects. He once said that the emotion was in the emulsion, like recognizes like. Scorsese imitates John Cassavetes' film, but his technique is not showboating. In ""Goodfellas,"" the famous long take between Henry Hill and his girlfriend showcases the full force of his technique, capturing a specific moment in time in its delirium and voluptuousness. Scorsese's work is a pleasure to watch and a testament to his mastery of filmmaking. The story revolves around a tragic and unreconciled tragedy, which may explain Scorsese's decision to go in a heartbreakingly intimate direction. Ernest's inadequacy causes him to torture himself to death, and the story never achieves closure or redemption. By the time Scorsese delivers the movie's final lines, placing himself alongside the showmen and sensationalists who have told the Osage murders over the decades, the movie feels like an open wound until the end, leaving viewers surprised that the movie is over. David Scorsese directed the film adaptation of David Grann's 2017 book, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI. Scorsese wrote the script from the Bureau of Investigation's perspective, but DiCaprio suggested Mollie Burkhart as the heart of the story. After multiple conversations with Osage leaders, Scorsese realized that Flower Moon wasn't his story to tell. He realized that the only way to direct the film was to get out of the way. Flower Moon, despite its three-plus-hour runtime, showcases Scorsese's restraint and is considered one of his greatest films. Scorsese, a renowned filmmaker, is seen in a black suit, slightly hunched, and tepid in this film. He reads from Mollie Burkhart's obituary, which describes her suffering from the same disease as the film. Scorsese utters the conspiracy that killed her family, but there is no mention of the murders. He is alone under a literal spotlight, speaking to the audience not in the theater on-screen but to us. The film highlights the destruction caused by greed, ambition, and war, and the human tendency to erase them.",positive
518,"I would expect more when it comes to such an important event in American history . The film started with a brief history information for viewers to know how was it in 1910 but to be honest it could much deeper , much more creative and much more to say or show about that time and generally the life of First Nation . (Like Argo for example)Screenplay and way to me had a very low pace . Mystery was missing . Action was missing . Directing was ok but a bit boring . So many scene had much better potential, to me the film looked like a low budget because of so many scene was indoor .Leo was as always good . His wife in the film was also good . I think their character had much more potential to make it even cooler than this .Art direction , make up , costume was so underwhelming.Most of the film was silent or only dialogues which was ok .",positive
519,"Killers of the Flower Moon is quite possibly director Martin Scorsese's darkest and most dour film to date. While most of his historical films find a balance between the good and the bad elements of their events, this film (outside of some funny lines and scenes of levity) is almost entirely serious, depicting the horror and evil inherent in this story in an honest, raw, and blunt manner that leaves you shaken. The film is well paced and never loses your interest, surprising given its three and a half hour runtime. And, a rarity for a Scorsese film, the swearing is kept to a minimum, with a total of only three F words.The first time I watched the film, I felt like the character development seemed to be missing a scene, as Leonardo DiCaprio is seemingly onboard with the conspiracy without much buildup. Watching it again, however, I see clearly how well Robert de Niro manages to manipulate and corrupt him in a way that's subtle and not right in your face. In general, the cast is absolutely exceptional, especially DiCaprio, de Niro, and Lily Gladstone. But, with three Oscar winners in the cast (Brendan Fraser is also in it), that should go without saying. Gladstone in particular was completely cheated by the Oscars. Emma Stone was great, but she already had an Oscar. But hey, being the first Native American to be nominated was still a huge accomplishment.Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time. Even his films I don't like, such as Hugo, are well shot and directed. This film is no exception. The sets and costumes all look great. The Osage culture is beautifully captured and, from what I've heard, very accurate. The music is incredible, including an unnerving tune almost like a heartbeat that plays whenever a murder's happening. And the sound design is well done, with a few well timed jump scares thrown in. One scene that especially stands out involves De Niro's men burning his fields for him to collect insurance. The music, editing, and lighting all come together in a haunting, dramatic scene that really sticks with you long after it's over.Overall, Killers of the Flower Moon won't appeal to everyone given its length and subject matter. However, I don't think anyone should let these factors deter them from seeing this fantastic film that you will remember long after the credits roll.",positive
520,"This was such a sad movie. What's worse is that it's all facts...this was history...very shameful of our country, for what they did to the Native American people. I will say Leo is absolutely amazing as always! I wanted him to be a good guy, but throughout it, he became just as awful of a man as the rest of them. He really takes on his characters!! The whole star-studded cast were perfectly placed in their parts given and even Mr Scorsese, himself, makes a cameo! I hope people learn from this film, that our history is real and that they did so much damage to so many people who were unlike themselves...My only wish was that it was cut an hour shorter, but I understand why it had to be as long as it was. It won't let you down...watch it...just give yourself time to actually sink it all in...put down your phone and really pay attention.",positive
521,"This film probably is enjoyed by a certain audience and I respect everyone has their tastes but the beauty of a lot of films is that whatever genre, a good film can engage anyone, this is not that.To be honest if I see Leo I do think ""boring long slow film"" but this was endless, the cinema was packed which was great but within 20 minutes about 8 people had left, more followed over the next half hour. It was so slow it felt endless, the acting was unimpressive, the characters were bland and the design and set up where underwhelming.The story is obviously important so no disrespect on any events but this film isn't good. It'll win Oscar's no doubt but nearly every year, Oscar winning films are as painful as having your eyeballs tattood.I'm sure everyone will rave about it but from my experience and the one cinema I was in, close to a quarter left before half way and two separate people caused hysterics as they were loudly snoring, that's the truth, if you love that type of film or story, it's all yours, if your looking for entertainment or a fun night, skip this.It felt about 3 1/2 weeks let alone hours.",positive

523,"""Gotta better chance of convicting a guy for kicking a dog than killing an Indian...""In the first quarter of the last century, American neo-colonialism took the form of disenfranchising the Osage Indian tribe from their rights to the vast oil fields of Northern Oklahoma. Director and co-writer (with Eric Roth) Martin Scorsese, in an adaptation of David Gunn's 2017 book Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the F. B. I, tackles this sorrow with ease and ferocity as he depicts the investigation of the murderers responsible for the disappearances and deaths of multiple Osage women.Not only does the director hold us spellbound for almost 3 hours and a half, he employs two Oscar winners to make sure. Leo DiCaprio's Ernest Burhart is a dimwitted naif moving to Oklahoma eventually marrying into the tribe and working for his uncle, the ""King of the Osage"" William Hale (Robert De Niro), a seeming supporter of the Osage but a conniver for the headrights of any Indian crossing his path.As we witness each duplicitous moment with these two plotters, we become immersed in the Indian ways, so careful is Scorsese to re-create the homely belongings and vintage autos that represent the emergence of America into the century but its demise at the same time. The Boschian silhouette scene in horrific orange and red while men fight a blaze is an apt metaphor for the hell Americans created for the Indians and the downward direction of the American dream so imbued is it in murder and greed. Appropriately the time has been called The Osage Reign of Terror.Ernest's marriage to the enigmatic and discerning Osage named Mollie (Lily Gladstone, a strong contender for an Oscar) represents the hope of integration yet becomes a symbol of appropriation. DiCaprio and Gladstone were meant to connect in this role, he enthusiastically simple minded and she smartly contained.Although the atrocities of Hamas now dwarf most expressions of outrage, the crimes against the Indians stand in stark relief alongside them.

As in Oppenheimer, you'll never regret the three hours.",positive
524,"Unfamiliar with Osage and other related issues, I truly felt the film, story, screenplay, sound, acting and direction were masterclass. Cannot be denied that it is year's best film and probably one of the best ever. Three plus hours and didn't feel at all dragged. So compelling .. the only issue I felt a couple of times was related to editing/cuts. Otherwise, I felt it took me to that period of history. Brilliant filmmaking; all actors were so good. The last 5-10 mins of stage narration was something I had never seen before.Overall, I a great moviegoer experience. Looking forward to upcoming works of Scorcese.",positive
525,"Why don't directors get the concept of an intermission?3h26m for a film means the movie goer isn't just in the seat for that time, but add on at least 10 to 15 min MORE for many, who have to come and claim a seat, come in get settled watch 10min+ of movie previews and theatre notes and the film begins. People sitting in their seat for nearly FOUR HOURS. Directors, wtf, we need a bathroom break! We don't want to leave and miss action on a film we paid to be in, and we can't pause it.The editing was poor at times, jumping around. At least one point there was a non-sequitor of people seeing news of the Tulsa racial violence, slaughter of African Americans, but it hardly covers it, then immediately jumps back to the flow of the film. What was the point, other people were mistreated by American civilians, local, state, federal gov't? Yes for sure but the film is already covering that. The editing at times felt just...*jumpy* amateur.It's an important film topic for sure, that hasn't been looked into enough, addressing the layers of how one tribe were completely abandoned mistreated by the state and federal gov't. It was embarrassing and cruel the way the gov't didn't step in and help, sheriff being incompetent, corrupt, state not doing anything, federal gov't barely getting involved even after dozens clearly murdered. After the private detective went 'missing' there should certainly have been a manhunt which would have saved others, peeled away at that rotten onion of violent yt people savagely willing to kill for a chance at dirty money inheritance.I would have given another star as I saw MANY people get up and use the restroom during the film and I myself would have used that refresher with an intermission, the film just dragged on without one. It felt just a bit long, dragging after 2hr though would have been far better movie-going experience with an intermission.",positive
526,"LIKES:The Cinematography:
-It starts with the filters, each one selected to bring an atmosphere that feels engaging, big and bold, painting emotions with the material.-Bold camera work then comes at just the right angles to optimize looks and bring so much more to simple acts. All the looks, movement, and line delivery,
-The direction to have the camera move during some scenes was never too overbearing, and it maximized so much of the scene in a way that wasn't' distracting.-It really tells a tale on its own, but yet is just a foundation or accessory to other elements.The Story:
-The movie feels like a historical novel, and the story has enough engaging elements to get an audience looking for a grounded story, rather than a blockbuster.-Flower Moon's tribe has a lot of deep layers, a moral tribulation of various characters and just what they would do to meet their goals.-A character study in many regards Scorsese's brilliance brings a CSI feel, with Western vibes, and a bit of a drama with it together Such a presentation helps add that entertainment element to the historical drama, and give it a little more than others in this film.-As for relevance, it may not be the news stories right now, but it still snaps its jaws down on some heavy things from the past and the lessons they can teach.The Setting/Recreations
-A historical drama requires you to make history come to life, which requires great costumes and settings.-Goal achieved. Flower Moon's world is beautifully reconstructed to be very accurate, believable, and representing of the cultural and political times, with tribal garments in some levels, those pollical cowboy ventures, and even the mealy and disheveled appearances.-Costumes aside, the town's reconstruction comes next. Sure the farm shots remind me of Yellowstone, but the actual towns hold that old world charm of dirt streets, crowded parlors, and homes that don't have as much modernization
-And throw in the cars, props, and other settings in terms of entertainment, and the immersion continue to impress for a movie like this.-It all just really helps the historical focus come out to a full extent, and gives you that layer that fans like I enjoy, when it comes to seeing these pieces come to life.The Acting:
-If you are going for Oscars, you need to make sure you have the actors to bring it to life, and this movie succeeds very well in this caveat.-Gladstone is a fantastic actress for what she was tasked to do. Romance with speculation, stubborn streaks with a warrior's charm, only love a vulnerability, and even suffering motions. All of these elements she executed well, delivering her lines with a tomahawk sharpness that I loved and wanted more of.-De Niro is, well, De Niro. He might not have the range he once did but the Mafia like delivery, that politician presence, and that devilish nature are done so well in this movie. His line execution is incredible, and the way he has that physical acting down, brings more weight to his words and more fear than most horror movie characters do for me.-DiCaprio does his job well once more, only this time not quite the steadfast cowboy, or survivalist as he plays. His character has a lot of differences, and through the narrative an evolution that he does well to convey the sheer torture of this world.-Everyone else hits their marks for the most point, and really crafts this dramatic group to a level that is believable, but engaging when used right.The Writing:
-By far, the writing is my favorite aspect of the movie.-This film has strong writing, dialogue that holds a lot of impact, each word an element of the character that feels real, but yet stands out.-Every scene has dialogue that has importance to the plot, but isn't just wasted in some trivial and sloppy line, but rather a bit more poetic and designed.-And yet, it's not too convoluted, blending the language and the cultural tones into it without getting lost in the agenda or convoluted writing these films can be.-Yet, the writers seemed to write the lines for the actors and found that there was some form of conforming to each person and giving it even more of a powerful presentation.-With the story, the character focus, and the intelligence to this movie, you really do have writing that conveys a narrative that can be a bit unique, especially at the end with the finish they did.DISLIKES:Depressing:
-If you do the research, you know this movie is about a very tragic time in human history with the Osage line.-Even then, the movie goes a tad excessive in the throngs of depression, leaving me feeling empty, spent, and quite honestly horrified at the darker elements of humans.-With a very lengthy run, this consistent dismay settles like a storm cloud, and really just bombards you with it to the point that it can be exhausting.-And there are very few moments to relieve it, little action, little mystery, and even fewer happy moments to cut through it, all choosing to stay in the constant state of depression.Boring:
-I say this in terms of for a Western element, and what the trailers showed, there was little action or mystery to solve.-It's a crime and drama, but unlike the shows I like to watch, missed a little of the dark mystery elements and suspense I wanted to see.-The dryer content need a little more moisture primarily to again help break up the slow as molasses pace this movie suffers from in the first half of the film.Character usage:
-You might see an actor or actress on the extensive list that has gotten you excited to see in this movie and make it worth it right?-Use caution my friends. Scorsese has loaded this with a lot of actors and about 65% of them fail to have massive screen time. Fraser and Lithgow are the two biggest disappointments for me. They do well, don't get me wrong, but they have very little time on screen, drowned out by the top three billed groups.-And even some of the bigger cast got dropped a bit at times, or their characters directed towards a direction that was boring. So be careful of committing your time for an actor who might be in the film for fewer than fifteen minutes.The Time:
-It's a big part of the discussion online, and both sides make fair points.-Personally, 3.5 hours can be done, but you have to make sure that it's spaced and engaging enough for me, to get the points for it being worth it.-Without relevance, personal connection, or a massive history loving, this movies time commitment felt a bit too much for me.-And when combined with the depression nature of everything, it only further dragged the movie out to what felt like 5.5 hours.-Thus, this aspect was a bit of a dig for me and kind of hurt the movie's other elements because it was too drawn out.-Yet, if you meet and just love this story and very focused on the book, this dislike will not hold as much merit.The VERDICT
Killers of the Flower Moon is a magical movie of Hollywood spectacle. It's a fantastically shot film with all the bells and whistles for bringing the emotion and the times alive. Hard subject material that requires attention, the movie tells a very well adapted and thought out plot with writing that feels so personable and personal and yet not preachy, well most of the time. And the acting achieves great levels of Oscar level goodness that are a staple to the Scorsese time frame. But, for all the good and Academy expectations, the movie does suffer a bit for me in regards to just how hard it can be to watch the movie. Character usage and hard subject matter are the easier dislikes to get through, but the depression and that time frame go hand in hand to make this movie feel like it is taking forever and amplifies some of the other dislikes. Without any relief, or any excitement, the movie's Historical Drama is the selling point and what you need to get ready for to maximize your enjoyment. Still, it's a good film and I can recommend that it's worth the awards and the time, but for most probably best left for home viewing.My scores are:Crime/Drama/History: 8.0 -8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0.",positive
527,"What's wrong with these new companies production?Every time I give them (Netflix, Apple and Amazon) a chance to watch their new product, I regret. The story itself is great. Everything else is not worth watching (or listening to) the sound track is awful. The actors either not convinced themselves or exaggerating. Despite the movie is too long , there are a lot of events that lack building up. I spent the whole first 45 minutes in the beginning hoping that the movie would get better but the waiting went in vain, besides, the movie has a lot of irrelevant sceens that have no connection to core of the story.",positive
528,"Please stop already with the ""...too long"" comments. You knew from the get-go how looonng this film is. Viewing it on a small screen just would not do it justice. I did also love ""Oppenheimer"" but it was simply a different film!Enough rant.This film absolutely enveloped me. With its brooding, dismal, painful story-telling, it took me in and allowed me to feel these peoples' tragedy in a short 3.5 hours. I felt the agonizing and slow-to-develop illnesses that seemed so confusing to these people who trusted their ""caregivers"" implicitly, and their suspicions weren't quick to surface. Their horror was palpable.They were punished more after being given the supposed ""trash location"" to move to, Oklahoma, and then became the unwilling victims of greed and corruption. I am a resident of Oklahoma and I knew nothing of this disgrace.The cast were well-chosen. Mr. Scorsese worked hard to develop the characters into believable, suffering individuals who had increasingly less and less control over their own fate.I would absolutely recommend everyone see this.I saw it in the biggest and best theater I could find. After reading all the hype I wanted to be immersed and give that hype the chance to be confirmed and it was.Go. Just go.",positive
529,"Killers of the Flower Moon tells the real story of a group white settlers who try to murder a bunch of native people's to steal their oil money. The main character is in love with a native woman, and her family is the main victims that his uncle is systemically killing. This is a really unpleasant film in many ways. The only likable character is the wife and she's drugged out half of the movie. The acting and set pieces are terrific, and the film very much deep dives into these horrible crimes and make you understand them. But it's a VERY long film that feels even longer than it is, the pace of the film is bogged down by a script that is more like a documentary than a real character study - but at the same time - you do learn a lot about this period of history. This film is recommended for anyone who likes Scorcese movies and good cinema.",positive
530,"I love when people go and see a movie that is over three hours long and then complain that it was three hours long ???Could the movie be shorter, yes. But when you see a movie time of over three hours, you must know going in that it is THREE HOURS! People always complain that the book is better than the movie, but then when a movie is long and gives quite a bit of detail, they also complain ???Due to the length of this movie, you get beautifully intricate details of what happened that you just wouldn't have received from a two hour movie. That's what makes this movie so good. With that being said, for me, it didn't feel like it was three and a half hours long. The pacing of the movie felt fine for me.Anyways, this is a must see movie for so many reasons; history, culture, awesome acting, amazing cinematography, fantastic directing, heart wrenching emotions, and breath taking music.If you don't want to see a long movie, don't watch it...but if you want to see a must see historical movie with quite a bit of detail, then watch this amazing movie.",positive

533,"Killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama mystery historical romantic film directed by ""the martin scorsese"".Leonardo dicaprio somehow manages to surprise me every time. Time and time again, he proves his mettle with films beyond some vain performance. He lives the characters the way they are meant to be. I cannot cite only one scene where he dominates everybody 'cause that will be a shame to his potential. Robert de niro, is timeless. He is beyond the realms of worldly acting, its eternal. Lily gladstone is ailing throughout the film and she manages to make love through the melancholy in the film. Its a tragic piece of cinema, and she plays her part. There is not one performance that you or I can find fault in.The writing of this film is outstanding. The characters have immense depth, numerous shades except for king hale. That character was somewhat one dimensional. The screenplay oozes of subtle drama and tragedy. It angers you with its plight, it concerns you with its negligence. Martin scorsese talks about the time on which the great american dream is built upon, the lives of many indigenous residents. That is itself where the film is a victory.The background score, the music, the sound design is enthralling. The cinematography by rodrigo prieto to and about us. Its a film relevant till date. And will remain so, the greatest victory a story can have.",positive
534,"I really wanted to like this film, it was very well made, as usual the direction was excellent, the cast was fantastic with Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro both outstanding.This is a very important story that needed to be told and I'm certain there are hundreds of other stories of Native American decimation by white supremacists and overly entitled white men.The primary issue I had with this film is that Scorsese has become the most over indulgent director of the decade. I think that considering his status nobody is able to say no to him and nobody is able to reign him in, he is a bit like the David Lynch of the 2020s in a sense that he just does whatever he wants. This movie was not nearly as tedious as the Irishman which should have been a four-part miniseries and had way too many 8 minutes scenes that should have been edited down to 2 minutes. But this film was overly long very tedious at times and it took quite a bit of work to get through it. I didn't expect to be entertained by it, but a more disciplined approach to editing would have turned out a much tighter and far more watchable film.",positive
535,"It is the latest film directed by Martin Scorcese. It has the usual Scorsese crew behind the scenes, including Thelma Schoonmacher doing the editing role that she has done with every Scorsese film since Woodstock. And features a killer soundtrack of 1920's blues and HIllbilly music, plus the last film score created by Robbie Robertson of The Band.It Stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Deniro and Lilly Poundstone and a massive crowd of others. The film is an American epic Western crime drama film. It is a true story and Its plot centers on a series of Oklahoma murders in the Osage Nation during the 1920s, committed after oil was discovered on tribal land.I really liked the movie. It's 3 and 1/2 hour run time did not feel like 3 and 1/2 hours. Especially sitting in one of AMC's signature recliners. Lilly Poundstone gave and absolutely amazing performance and I'm ready to predict that she will walk away with the oscar for best Actress this year. It has a plot that thickens by the minute. Its recreation of the USA circa 1920 is superb. They spared no expense. Leo Plays another villain. This time a very complex villain. There is a lot of information to take in. So much so, that I will probably need a second viewing to be able to process it all.It's a heck of a lot better than Oppenheimer, I'll tell you that... But this is not a ""feel good"" film. It builds to more horrific stuff with every minute. A really sad story. Glad to see Scorcese not repeating himself and trying to turn this into Casino or The Departed. It has it's own feel. As it is its own story. There is some real poetry and serious symbolism going on in some of the cinematography.",positive
536,"1919, Osage County, Oklahoma. Due to the discovery of oil on their land the Osage people are per capita the wealthiest people in the United States. Having just been discharged from the US Army, Ernest Burkhart returns to the area to work for his wealthy uncle, William Hale. Lately many Osage people have died in suspicious circumstances but nothing is being done about it.Written and directed by Martin Scorsese and based on a true story, Killers of the Flower Moon is an examination of greed and its consequences. Scorsese paints a chilling picture of the lengths some people will go to feather their own nests, even when they already have much, and the innocent lives that get destroyed in the process.He is aided in this endeavour by excellent performances in the lead roles: Leonardo DiCaprio as Burkhart, Robert De Niro as Hale and Lily Gladstone as Mollie. The supporting cast is star-filled and includes Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow and Brandan Fraser. Jack White even makes a brief appearance and Scorsese himself gets a rare speaking part!On the negative side, the film is unnecessarily long. I'm not one to criticise films simply for being long - often it's necessary- but in this case it is not justified. At 3Â½ hours the film is a grind in some parts.The set up takes at least an hour, an hour that is often filled with details that aren't important and where every scene feels like it's stretched to the max.The tempo steps up in the next 1.5 hours but even here there's a fair degree of filler and drawn-outness. The final hour or so is great and does bring the film home in style and at pace but doesn't entirely make up for the slowness of the previous 2.5 hours.There's also a pacing issue in that amidst all the drifting there's some major revelations. Because of the slowness around these scenes you get taken by surprise when there something so significant does occur. This is good in terms of shock value, if you spot the development, but you're liable to dismiss the development as you're so used to the drip feeding of information that such a torrent can't possibly be correct. It also creates a jarring start-stop rhythm.Overall, a good, but not brilliant, film.",positive
537,"KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON
(Movie Review)
Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DiNero & Lily GladStone
MPAA rating (R)
Written by: Eric Roth & Martin Scorcese
Directed by: Martin Scorcese
Star rating 5 out of 5THIS IS THE MOVIE THAT SHOULD'VE WON
BEST PICTUREKillers Of The Flower Moon which stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DiNero and Lily GladStone is about a series of murders that takes place on an Oil Reservation which is owned by the Indian Osage Nation Tribe. GladStone plays the role of Mollie Burkhart who is trying to save her Indian Community from anymore harm and killing, while Ernest Burkhart who is portrayed by DiCaprio think that his uncle, William Hale, played by DiNero has his best interest at heart and is looking out for him, but what he's really doing is looking out for himself, what it comes down to is choosing his wife's side, his uncle's side or nobody's side at all, and what will his final decision be in the end, because DiCaprio's character Ernest has an important decision to make. I saw Killer's Of The Flower Moon in November of 2023 on the seventh. I didn't know going into this picture that this was based on a novel, I was rating and reviewing this movie as a film buff according to Martin Scorsese's other movies, like Goodfella's Casinos' The Irishman, which came out not that long ago, Mean Streets and The Wolf Of Wall Street. I still need to see his big picture Raging Bull, I just wanted to take some time during this review to mention that movie really quick. I really do love the writing in Killers Of The Flower Moon, the movie script is magnificently written and I could tell that Martin Scorsese and Eric Roth wrote the heck out of this script. They worked incredibly hard, which is super rare nowadays. Most filmmakers just want to slap a movie together and get it out there. A lot of the professional movie critics slammed this movie and talked about how bad it was and other movie fanatics gave it a hard time because of how long it is. Even Jimmy Kimmel at the Oscars made a joke about how long this movie is. It truly is sad to see how low our standards have become, and how even as adults our attention spans have gone down and we only want to see movies that are an 1 hr. 30 minutes. - 1 hr. 35 minutes. Long. It just breaks my heart. Sure this movie is incredibly long, but that's because it is necessary in this case, it has a lot of character development and a lot to say. People just can't appreciate the serious art form anymore. The Oscars have become a joke now a days, I haven't seen Oppenheimer yet and I surely will see it, but I can't wrap my head around why so many movie fanatics say that this movie is way to long and how they always have to find something wrong with a movie that is clearly Oscar winning material. The script is solid and Martin Scorsese directed this movie with pride, and made sure his vision went from script to screen smoothly and the transition happened without any hiccups that I could spot. The acting from everyone was great and was solid. DiCaprio and DiNero were in the movie, This Boy's Life and they great together in that movie as well. They played alongside each great again in Killers of the Flower Moon. From the first scene they were in together both of their acting were spot serious movie fanatics and movie buffs who really watched this film can tell you that this movie means business, whether you saw this movie in the theater or at home on streaming. Out of all of the movies in 2023 that I saw this is the one that should've won Best Picture. The editing is really good, I could tell that the editor worked with Scorsese and they trimmed the film up nicely as all filmmakers and editors do. There's plenty of good realistic wardrobe costuming that gives a great historic feel to this film that makes this movie all the more real and adds realism, along with the special effects and props during the murder scenes that aren't to bad at all and look quite realistic to be honest once the killings do begin in the movie. Lily GladStone's performance is very good, especially when she's with Leonardo DiCaprio, I think the both of them shine together very brightly and bring out the best acting in each other. I hope Lily GladStone gets more acting roles I would love to see her in more movies, seeing here in Killers of the Flower Moon does showcase her true talent in acting. The cinematography is really good at times it gives a western type of vibe combined with a gangster style. There's a scene that has to do with an explosion of a house which I didn't see coming and there's plenty of things in store for audiences. I highly recommend Killers of the Flower Moon and no matter what the members of the motion picture of the institute of arts and science say this the film that should have won best picture right here ladies and gentleman, without any doubts in my mind. We saw both sides of the story of the gangsters and the Osage Nation Tribe, anyone who says we didn't see enough of the story regarding the Osage Nation Tribe wasn't really watching the movie or they just don't understand that it's impossible to cram everything that a entire book has into a movie. If Scorsese did put everything that the book had into this movie then we all would've been sitting in the theater or in front of our TV screens for probably fifteen - seventeen hours straight. There's no way that anyone is gonna sit there for that long. He did a great job, and people are talking about how he needed to shorten it down, if he had shortened it down then people would be complaining that it was to short. This movie was done to perfection and everyone should see this one and when you watch it you will see why it is a real masterpiece.Written by

538,"Atmospheric and gripping. The accents/drawl can be a little too authentic, but its just a nitpick. I was impressed with how this story was able to allude (subtly) to the similarities of the Tulsa Race Massacre. It can be a difficult watch, if only for the fact that a movie like is only touching the surface of some of the uglier parts of how some Americans attained their wealth and riches at the expense of the innocent and maybe more deserving. The violence can be a bit jarring because it is unflinching, but drives home the fact these crimes were calculated and coldblooded.Hope this becomes a classic.Loved this movie. Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio continue to be a legendary pairing.",positive
539,"First off, yes, it is a looooong movie. But it is a good one, if you don't have patience for good storytelling and want to whip out your phone to be on your socials, this is NOT for you.Set in the same time frame as the Tulsa Massacre it angers to see such greed perpetrated by certain groups of people. Did this movie anger me? Yes it did but not because the movie was bad because it was so good in exploring the storylines that it makes you want to jump and punch the evilness in its face.The actors were spectacular, the visuals, lovely and the coatumes, what can i say but beautiful and so glad Mr. Scorsace did his homework and showed us the beauty that was intertwined with the ugliness of evil. Storyline was solid and yes there is talking involved (no phones, computers back then folks) but it makes you get involved into the lives of these people.Living now in Oklahoma one thing seemed funny to me. Only a brief mention was made of the Drummond (pioneer woman fame) family. They own alot, and i mean alot, of land that was stolen in this way from the Osage and not a word of that was said. Did they have anything to say about this movie? Of course not. The Osage are fighting to get it back, but you know, Oklahoma has a reputation for not being real Native friendly, movie/history for points.If you have time, sit back, relax and get ready for a good movie by a great directior and great actors.",positive
540,"This movie feels like it was made in the 90s when just having a string of events following one another without craftful editing and just loosely connected dialogue succeeded bringing in millions when you just got the casting right. Nowadays this type of filmmaking indicates outdatedness.The good points of this movie :
robert de niro is fantastic, he plays the two faced smiley greedy villain character to perfection. He has you questioning his real intentions right to the end without revealing too much about his undisguised personality while also being ruthless. Lily gladstone also strong contender for main actress awards, just loved her portrayal of non non-sense but vulnerable portrayal of Mollie Burkhart.The cast all in all very good.Furthermore the whole story shown from a wide range of narrative angles is very captivating, as you are watching a murder mystery unfolding from multiple angles whilst also being given the answer from the very beginning.Bad points:
The obvious one, it is way too long with a lot of scenes consisting of slowly spoken dialogue and exposition. The movie feels like a drag one hour in and you wish you had spared yourself the movie ticket for a comfy and pausable streaming experience.Di caprio as the dimwitted but sinister husband was uninspired. If you have ever watched a dicaprio movie you will frustratingly notice that his range is very limited. It is Leo just using lines of dialogue explaining to you that he is another person whilst never really putting any effort into changing voice, posture or gesture. Different clothes, different dialect and different lines of dialogue does not change you into another person unfortunately.So all in all very decent movie to stream, not worth a movie ticket though.",positive
541,"After having eagerly awaited Scorsese's follow up to The Irishman for so long, I was so excited to see this film as his newest work.I was very bitterly disappointed to find a dull, repetitive, shallow and just plain boring movie with nothing of substance to offer.The first 2 and a half hours of this film is a collection of scenes that follow the exact same formula of whites acting greedy and despicable, committing atrocities and then the Native Americans lamenting their situation, rinse and repeat about a dozen times and you have the first 2.5 hours of this movie.The plot doesn't move forward until much later when Jesse Plemons shows up and I was waiting the whole time for him to show up because I knew the plot wouldn't start moving until he did. The investigation by Plemons was quite engaging to watch and the most enjoyable part of the film.There is little to no depth to be found in any of the characters, white or Native. Each character is defined by a single shallow trait such as greed, stupidity, suffering or sociopathy and there are little to no opportunities for the audience to get a glimpse of their souls or inner workings of their minds to understand their complex motivations. The Native American characters in particular are not given much personality and mostly exist as stand ins for slasher movie victims for the white villains to slaughter.The acting and performances are competently done as expected of the cast and there are some very beautiful shots in this film but the story or perhaps the lack of it, makes it a very painful and laborious watch and just a chore to sit through in the theater.",positive
542,"A great sadness and despair is seeping and creeping throughout the Osage community. The depths of depravity and evil which humans can inflict upon each other is harrowingly told with a mastery of storytelling which Martin Scorsese has developed over a passionate lifetime. In the name of God, the unconscionable actions of the opportunistic invaders are expropriating vast amounts of wealth through some of the most sinister conduct imaginable.Pretending to be in love, getting married, and murdering to get ahead is, unfortunately, an old story. What makes Killers of the Flower Moon so haunting is in telling the tale of how widespread evil can become, and how desperate a community can feel as they gradually lose hope. The movie is also a lesson in just how far into the depths of depravity we can go if we believe, and can make others believe, that the Others are not human, something which comprises a cornerstone of inhumanity. The movie is not good because it is excellent. It is good because it is a historical document and reminder of how quickly and easily society can devolve through greed and hate.Lily Gladstone gives us a performance of quiet power with dignified indignation. The final minutes are a chilling bit of masterpiece, a chance to gasp and exhale after a bittersweet aftertasting dÃ©nouement.",positive
543,"... I wish I had the opportunity share more of it! It wasn't long, if it was, I didn't have the time to notice. I didn't have time to notice because there was DiCaprio oozing his character every which way, finding the Osage land, weaving through its 20's streets, wooing Mollie, fearing Hale, defining Anna, loving Mollie, loosing his little girl, loathing Hale, and loving himself, yes I din't have time to notice the time. And then there was DeNero, charming as ever, even through his blatantly cruel stance on all other lives. But there was also Lilly Gladstone- a name I never knew till now, and a name that'll get me to the theatres on day one from now on... She is so beautiful, beautiful through her reservation, through her apprehension, through her faith, through her respect, through he love, through her fear, through her grief, through her joy, through her resolve, through her courage, through her loss, through her sickness, through her helplessness, through her determination, through he discovery, and finally through her crisp anger as she got up from her chair in one swift move turned her back walked out on DiCaprio.And I didn't even have time to notice there was a director...",positive
544,"First things first, this film is 3 hours and 25 minutes so if you are going to the cinema you might need to prepare accordingly. My screening did not have an interval but some do. Thankfully I was able to avoid going to the toilet during the film.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a true story of the when oil is found in Oklahoma under the Native American Osage Nation Land as a result of which they become rich. As new individuals start to show up on the land, members of the Osage people begin to die and the films takes us on a journey from there.Killers of the Flower Moon has some big names and the acting delivers. There will be multiple Oscar nominations both on and off the screen. We witness strong performances from Di Caprio and De Niro but Gladstone's performance injects the heart into the film.The story is an interesting, important and sad one. I'm glad that Scorsese used his craft tell it. Whilst I enjoyed the movie and was engaged I definitely felt the 3 hours and 25 minutes. It could have been shorter. For the cinephiles, it is worth seeing in the cinema otherwise you could watch at home although I fear that one may get distracted due to the run time.",positive
545,"First things first great visuals, great frames, great costume and production design. Bang on casting, well crafted, Amazing music!! Yes the film seems too long and feels stretchy but the that's the whole idea the overlooked facts of that time and actual incident to be point out. The rawness of that time, brains being cut out in front of the family members. The change of heart at the end was on point not too stretched. My good guess is 30mins fewer and more visual cuts would be great, but as the film is like I said the visuals and set were amazing. I find the roots of the culture were held tight and did justice to it.",positive
546,"A movie can make you feel happy, excited, make you laugh, feel sad og even cry. But following Leonardo Dicaprio stupidly carrying out an old man's murderous bidding for 3 hours - now that's just pure tragedy.At no point did I feel emotionally touched, I was just in awe of the pure slaughter unfolding on the screen - it was not a pleasant experience.The movie is a light 'Schindler's List' with fewer executions (though plenty) but in turn also lacks the depth and fulfilling resolution of the movie. Expect no great virtues from our protagonists.If you love women and children crying. This is for you.",positive
547,"Wow! What a Movie.Brutally well done. It was ALMOST at a perfection level. Almost. But god, it was such a great movie. I was angry, sad, chocked and everything you can say that relates to the story.The only thing missing was the gripping feeling you get in the last act. Where the ending is getting near and you are supposed to feel that feeling with all the characters and how you hoped they found peace.But at the same time, the focus of the movie wasnt on the innocent people that were victims of this horrible story, the focus was the those responsible for it all.So, 9 of 10. I'm satisfied, i would like to see it again.",positive
548,"Despite substantial emphasis on the depiction of Native Americans and women, this film remains exceedingly ""straight white male"" oriented. It's filled with paternalistic undertones throughout, yet surprisingly, it feels justified - likely owing to over three hours of densely packed environmental and contextual exposition. The narrative, however, does not offer enough twists and turns to keep the audience enthralled, but facing such a weighty subject matter, I have respect for the endeavor. It's not that the film is unwatchable, but the length of over three hours does make it a somewhat tedious viewing experience - although the use of audiovisual language throughout demonstrates a masterful craftsmanship, aiding in navigating through the complex, often dark waters of historical exploitation and systemic oppression.",positive
549,"Boring at times, yes
too long, yesat the same timeIncredibly emotionally gripping cinematic masterpiece that
brings to light a mostly forgotten piece of history.Also it was a complete twist on the ""western"" format, might even be Scorseses attempt at a historical conclusion to the format entirely. This film will change things and will as so many others only become more cherished in the future.The cinematography provides some scenes which pull forth an ancient tribal feeling, a connection with the surroundings that seems completely lost in other movies that make an attempt at it.In most films love seems to be about romance and the solution to problems. Here it is portrayed as ideal yet cursed. It leaves the viewer feeling hollow and bewildered.Deniro as the bad guy did not invoke any sympathy: also rare in current cinema. He was simply a monster from the first second to the last. Personally it was refreshing to see a bad guy without any backstory, remorse or exceptional ""coolness"".This is a masterpiece. A very speciel one.",positive
550,"I can see why Tarantino wants to stop making movies after 10 or thereabouts films. You either stop, like Tarantino wants to after 10 films and maintain his legacy( even though after Kill Bill(s) his quality dropped waaaay down off a cliff cuz he chose to write/direct films in a linear way but his only great linear screenplay is True Romance.Scorsese Should've stayed retired with his as close to perfection of a filmography can get. IMO & anyone who lived through the early 80s through mid 90s can tell you, Goodfellas is his best film he ever did or will make. Casino was in the same vein but to a slightly lesser extent. Some really like The Departed and I thought it was good but nothing groundbreaking. Much like Tarantino, his first 2 films were hands down his best. It's not even a debate. Killers of the Flower Moon offered no surprises, no big twists only subverted expectations as to an iconic name attached to it. Whomp whompðŸ˜¢. The best part was the acting by Leo & DeNiro...though DeNiro has gotten too old to play anyone powerful or threatening. Again, look to Raging Bull, Casino, Goodfellas, Godfather II, and my favorite DeNiro film where he's the ultimate tough guy in a perfect film-Heat. The most realistically shot and written heist/cops & robbers film ever made.",positive
551,"There's nothing to learn from this movie. Though the world is changing around them, the characters are stagnant and two-dimensional.While Lily Gladstone's character, Mollie Burkhart, gracefully waltzes through her scenes like the rolling plains of Oklahoma, Leo's character, Ernest, is anything but earnest.The movie does come off as an enactment of a true-crime podcast with a predictable outcome.The sets and costumes look authentic, so kudos to whoever did that.I spent most of the movie just waiting for something interesting to happen, but nothing did. There were two scenes in the whole movie that actually moved me: 1) Ernest decides to stand up for something and testifies in court. 2) Mollie meets him in the next scene and confronts him about what he did to her.I guess that is the crux of this movie. ""How far would you go for what you love?""
On a metaphorical note, I think Mollie represents the unblemished and sometimes gullible aspect of the natural world. And Ernest - Well, we're all Ernests (without the a) wrestling with our conscience, but eventually doing what's wrong.",positive
552,"Killers of the Flower is an action-packed thriller that takes viewers on a suspenseful journey filled with intense moments and unexpected twists. Directed by John Doe, this film showcases a dark and gritty world where corruption and greed run rampant.The story revolves around Jake, a skilled assassin who finds himself entangled in a dangerous game after accepting what seems like a routine job. As he delves deeper into his mission, he uncovers a web of conspiracy involving powerful individuals known as ""the flower,"" who control every aspect of society behind closed doors.One of the strengths of Killers of the Flower lies in its well-executed action sequences. The fight scenes are choreographed with precision, delivering thrilling moments that keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The film's cinematography adds to the intensity, capturing both close-quarters combat and high-speed chases with skillful camera work.The performances in Killers of the Flower are commendable, particularly by the lead actor portraying Jake. His portrayal adds depth to his character's internal struggle between morality and survival instincts. Supporting actors also deliver solid performances, bringing believability to their respective roles.However, where Killers of the Flower falls short is in its storytelling execution. While the initial setup promises an intriguing plot filled with political intrigue and mystery, it eventually becomes convoluted and confusing. The pacing can feel uneven at times, leading to moments where important information is rushed or glossed over.Additionally, some characters lack development or motivation beyond serving as mere plot devices or obstacles for our protagonist. This leaves certain relationships feeling underdeveloped or lacking emotional impact.Despite these flaws in storytelling execution and character development, Killers of the Flower manages to maintain viewer interest through its gripping action sequences and atmospheric visuals. The film successfully creates an immersive world that keeps audiences engaged throughout.In conclusion, Killers of the Flower is an entertaining action thriller that excels in its action sequences and gritty atmosphere. While it may stumble in terms of storytelling execution and character development, it still manages to deliver an enjoyable cinematic experience for fans of the genre.",positive
553,"The long-awaited new collaboration between Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese has arrived. So what can I say? Wonderful as always! Perhaps many will be put off by the enormous (perhaps this is the biggest cinematic experience in the lives of many), but these two professionals have not let us down yet. Moreover, in this film Scorsese brought together two of his favorites from different stages of his career, giving De Niro one of the main roles - the greedy and devilish uncle of DiCaprio's naive character.The acting in the film is simply amazing (I don't know who I'll be rooting for at the Oscars this year - I think I'll be torn between DiCaprio from The Killers and Murphy from Oppenheimer). Leo, as always, is gorgeous and again plays a new role for himself - a guy who is not particularly strong-willed, returning from the war, and having to choose between love for one of his family members and cruel and vile instructions from another. De Niro plays a sweet-looking grandfather who cares about every person he knows and doesn't know... who in fact is the very leader of the family, giving instructions about the murders of all these people. Both actors gave excellent roles as antagonists and deserve at least nominations for various awards.The plot of the film may not shine with much originality, but it presents itself properly, and all 3.5 hours fly by unnoticed, just like 3 hours in another hit of this year, ""Oppenheimer,"" even though the dynamics here are not just as powerful as in the Christopher Nolan film. Somewhere in the middle of the film, you may begin to get a little bored due to the monotony of the characters' actions, but eventually the action stops stagnating and events abruptly move to Act 3, which gives a new wave of excitement for the viewer.The only thing that left me with mixed feelings about the film was its ending, which turns the whole action into a radio play with our favorite maestro as the host. This, of course, looks quite unusual, but at the same time I want a more classic ending to the story, and this approach feels a bit off. However, in any case, this does not spoil the overall impression of the film.",positive
554,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a cinematic masterpiece that truly deserves my 9/10 rating. This film is not just a movie; it's an experience that engulfs you for its entire 3-hour duration. The storytelling is impeccable, with Martin Scorsese's direction elevating the narrative to new heights. The characters are not just well-written but are brought to life by phenomenal performances, making them resonate with the audience in a deeply impactful way.The attention to historical detail is admirable, immersing viewers in a compelling and often untold chapter of American history. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking, with each frame meticulously crafted to enhance the storytelling. The score complements the visuals perfectly, adding an additional layer of depth to the film.What stands out most, however, is how the film balances its narrative richness with emotional depth. It's a poignant exploration of themes that are as relevant today as they were in the era the film portrays. This film is not just entertainment; it's a thought-provoking journey that stays with you long after the credits roll.In summary, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a testament to Scorsese's genius as a filmmaker. It's a film that not only meets but exceeds expectations, solidifying itself as a significant work in the realm of cinema.",positive
555,"The biggest two disappointments about Killers of the Flower Moon are its length, and the implication throughout that Burkhardt is some sort of a patsy. A close third is that Mollie is ignorant to a fault, at least until the end, when she learns the truth.This is not unusual in Scorcese's movies. In most of them, there is not really a character who is good, who you can actually root for without having too many moral quandaries. In most of his crime thrillers, this is ok because part of the enjoyment of the movie is seeing the idiot criminal get his comeuppance for being an idiot (or arrogant).Here, we don't really get that. Despite the quality of acting, dialogue, cinematography, and depth of the story, we don't really have anyone we want to support. Of course, it should be Mollie and the rest of the Osage, but they are portrayed as ignorants totally naive to what is happening to them. I am not sure if this is directly intentional, but it came across to me as disrespectful. Only towards the end do we start to see any hint that they know just how badly they are being taken advantage of.At the same time, both Ernest Burkhardt and (sort of) William Hale are portrayed with a fair degree of complexity. Yes, they are both murderous villains here, but they are also shown as compassionate villains. Burkhardt loves his wife, to the point that we are never 100% sure what he is injecting her with, even though he surely must have known. Likewise, Hale is portrayed as a pillar of the community, who the Osage apparently trust so much to involve him in some of their most intimate affairs.True or not, this result does not make for a very satisfying watch, especially at more than 3 hours. At that kind of length, I would have much preferred more depiction or insight into what the rest of the Osage thought was going on. What were their responses? Were they really so naive, or were they instead too fearful to speak up?",positive
556,"Awesome cinematography, set design and costume design plunge us into Oklahoma in the 1920s, a time and place that witnessed the merger of the two great original sins of American history, genocide of Native Americans and slavery/racism, (i.e. Tulsa is just up the road). And director Martin Scorsese tells a mostly compelling story about the former scourge with weary, resigned compassion and bitterness being the prevailing tones. Gone is the manic energy and wild humor of ""Goodfellas"" and ""After Hours"". This is the film of an old guy who has a sad, sinful tale to tell and is going to take his time in the telling of it. Three and a half hours, to be exact. And while that obviously bothered some IMDB folks I think Scorsese, arguably the greatest of living American directors, has earned the right to his own pacing.A more valid criticism of this film has to do with the character of Ernest Burkhardt. When making a movie that focuses on pure good versus abject evil, as this one does, a good director and screenwriter will try mightily to inject some ambiguity into the main characters. Usually that is a good thing but In this case it results in a largely unconvincing portrayal of a manipulative scumbag, Ernest, as a clueless schlub who the viewer is asked to believe is someone who never realized his greedy, malevolent uncle is trying to kill his wife via phony insulin (administered by perhaps the two most morally corrupt physicians until the advent of Mengele). Not only is this characterization at variance with the book upon which the movie is based but it strains credulity to the breaking point. To accept it you would have to regard Ernest as a complete moron and if he is that then he is not worth our attention, much less our sympathy, which Scorsese and his co scenarist Eric Roth clearly intend him to be. And you certainly do not buy his very intelligent and perceptive Osage wife, Millie, loving him throughout and forgiving him so completely at film's end. Because Leonardo De Caprio and Lily Gladstone are such fine actors you watch their scenes together and admire their thespian skills but at no point do you believe that this was how it really went down between them. As far as how it went down between the Osage and the whites, though, I have no quibbles with this powerful work.Bottom line: Sometimes nuance can be your enemy. Give it a B.PS...DeNiro, like Biden, is ten years too old for his role.",positive
557,"Enjoyable enough, good acting, interesting historical story but for a supposed murder mystery it's completely without any intrigue or suspense. You know exactly who the protagonists are from about an hour in. De Niro is the same as he always is, Di Caprio is also fine. My main gripe is that the film is at least one hour and probably more like one and half hours too long. The first hour and a half is completely unnecessary, it adds very little as far as plot or character building. No doubt the plot is more contentious in the US, and some will be shocked at the way the Osage were treated but it all seemed depressingly obvious to me. Hard to recommend really.",positive
558,"Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into a disturbing chapter of American history. The film's narrative is rooted in the true story of the Osage Nation in 1920s Oklahoma, where the discovery of oil leads to a series of heinous crimes. Scorsese's direction is impeccable, creating a haunting and thought-provoking experience.Leonardo DiCaprio, in a career-defining role, portrays Ernest Burkhart, a character torn between greed and morality. His performance is nuanced and deeply affecting. Robert De Niro, as William Hale, showcases his legendary acting prowess, bringing a chilling depth to his character. Lily Gladstone's portrayal of Mollie Kyle is heart-wrenching, capturing the essence of loss and resilience.The film's structure, divided into three distinct sections, keeps viewers engaged. The first hour introduces the Osage Nation and key characters, the second focuses on the unfolding crimes, and the final part depicts the aftermath. This approach effectively builds tension and emotional depth.The attention to historical detail is evident in every aspect of the film, from costume and set design to the portrayal of cultural nuances. The film's length, over three hours, is justified by its rich storytelling and character development.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" not only entertains but also educates, shedding light on a seldom-discussed aspect of Indigenous history. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, prompting reflection on themes of greed, power, and racial injustice.In summary, this film is a must-see. It's a rare cinematic gem that combines historical accuracy, stellar performances, and masterful storytelling.",positive
559,"There's nothing that can be said negative about this film except its run time. Story is engaging and captivating, acting and set pieces are so real and engrossing. But at almost three and a half hours, by the end during the most important scenes, I'm not thinking about the story or the characters, I'm thinking about how my knees hurt and how bad I have to pee. Everyone else in the theater is shuffling in their seat too. Scorcese makes movies for the big screen, he's old school Hollywood, so he needs to take this into consideration now that he's putting out three plus hour long films. I could think of plenty of establishing shots and story beats that could have been cut and not affected the story. Otherwise release to streaming.",positive
560,"""Full Moon Killers"" is a thriller movie and, in my opinion, a very impressive production. The movie has a story that leaves the audience curious. It tells the story of a group of detectives who go after a serial killer who kills people during the full moon.The acting performances in the movie are quite successful. The emotional development and relationships of the characters draw the audience into the film. It also attracts attention with its dark and mysterious atmosphere. Throughout the film, the tension is kept high by constantly giving the impression that someone is being watched and is in danger.The script progresses fluidly and engagingly. The plot is full of unexpected twists and turns. Trying to guess who the killer is keeps the viewer in constant tension. At the same time, an in-depth character study from a psychological and mental perspective also stands out.The film also included technology well. The camera angles and shooting techniques used make the film even more impressive. The music was also used correctly and played a complementary role in the atmosphere.However, excessive use of violence and blood in some scenes may spoil the taste of the movie a bit. Still, for those who love thrillers, Full Moon Killers can be recommended as a must-watch movie.",positive
561,Robert De Niro is mesmerising as the sinister William Hale and Leonardo DiCaprio is quite superb too as the vile Ernest. It's a great compliment to Lily Gladstone that she matches these performances as Mollie the beautiful Osage woman who begins to fall victim to Hale's horrific plans. The cinematography succeeds in transporting the viewer back to Osage county in the 1920's and the filmakers also deserve credit for amplifying the light first shone on these crimes by the non fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Ultimately though at 206 minutes the film is far too long and it detracts from the power of the piece. This is an horrific and compelling true story that I just felt could have been more powerfully delivered.,positive
562,"I had high hopes from this one but keeping the acting and storyline aside, the movie disappoints a lot. The pace is extremely slow and at some points it gets quite boring. The movies is bearable only because of the well executed plot and brilliant acting, otherwise it would have been a disaster.Leonardo & De Niro were excellent as always and so were the other cast members. The length of the movie could've been shortened as it feels stretched out on many occasions. Overall, the pace and the length were an issue and the movie could've been shortened a bit. It felt unnecessary long and was quite unbearable at times.",positive
563,"I'm baffled at so many reviews complaining about this one being slow moving and boring. Both my wife and I were scared to jump into it after reading some of these. By the end of the film, we both looked at each other and said, ""wow, that was really good"". So is it long? Yes. Could it be shorter? Sure, but so much of that dialogue was necessary for character building. It's am important story and I think Scorsese did it justice. Both DiCaprio and DeNiro were amazing as always, but Lily Gladstone was brilliant. Leo and Lily should both get an Oscar for this one. Please watch it, it's definitely long but definitely not boring.",positive
564,"Sick and twisted piece of American history! Pretty brutal movie for a bunch of liberal snowflake actors. Leo is always brilliant, Acting is spot on, Greed is real and this movie shows that money is the root of all evil and what people will do to achieve it, who they will kill and who's life they are willing to ruin for it. I'm not a huge Martin Scorsese fan but this was great! I have this film rated at a solid 10 outta 10. It's a bit long but not boring. Definitely worth watching, I bought the Italian 4k version, it's over 3.5 hours, so we decided not to watch it in theaters. I highly recommend this film.",positive
565,"This was really lightweight story telling with multiple underwritten characters popping up and disappearing during the marathon length running time. It was hard to acquire sympathy or care about any of them - with the exception of Mollie Burkhart, played by an enchanting Lily Gladstone. You could look at her face all the live long day. But While De and Di ( De Niro and DiCaprio) gave solid enough performances the characters they played were so repugnant their destiny was not something this audience member was particularly invested in. Was this a story worth telling? Yes, just about - but there was really no need to spend 210 minutes telling it. This kind of cinematography belongs in the cinema yes, but you need a story the size of Apocalypse Now to keep people there that long. A small story then, and somehow you expected a whole lot more given the personnel involved.",positive
566,"I'm a huge fan of Martin Scorsese he really has made some all time great movies. But his very best films even the longer ones like gangs of new York and wolf of wall street work because even though they are long the dialogue is fast paced and tightly edited. While the dialogue here in this film seems to have a slow pause between each line there are far too many pauses, while this might be the case in real life as a film to engage the viewer some if not all of the extended talking needed just a little bit a speeding up less pauses more of getting to the point. While that is my first gripe the second is the budget where was 200 million spent. A period piece like Oppenheimer cost half this and has better cast filmed on the very expensive IMAX format for a mere 100 million half the cost.If it was a 4 part TV mini series it would be an expental piece of work. But it never really worked as an event movie for me just the length put me off watching this on the cinema. At home watching this with the ability to pause the film works far better. Yes it's well acted filmed and directed the story is engaging and interesting but it's just not as engaging as it should be. Major plot points seemed to be skimmed over and the story comes to a random end even though great length has been spent building the story up. I'm knocking a point off this movie because it's too deliberately slow and self indulgent because no one seems to have told this fantastic director he should have cut his darling.",positive
567,"I'd always thought that Martin Scorsese should make a western, a genre that has had a big influence on his own film making, and KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is probably as close as we will ever get to a film in that unique American genre. Based on the non-fiction book by David Grann, which is an account of a murder conspiracy on the Osage reservation in early 1920s Oklahoma, it is easy to see why this story drew Scorsese to it, for it is another tale of greedy and violent men determined to get away with as much as they can, and the law and morality be damned. But it should be said upfront, KILLERS is not a story with the propulsive energy and vicarious bad guy thrills of GOODFELLAS and THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, but a somber and brutal look at human nature at its worst, centered on a couple of characters lacking any redeeming charm. What Scorsese does in KILLERS that he didn't do in those other two films is give space and attention to the victims of his protagonists' crimes, in this case it the members of the Osage tribe, who were the benefits of sudden and tremendous wealth when oil was discovered on their tribal lands. As a result, there was a determined effort by a group of local Whites to pry that wealth away from them, and over the course of a three and a half hour running time, we see repeated attempts at fraud and outright murder to achieve this end, culminating when the nascent Bureau of Investigation (soon to have Federal added to its name) stepped in and achieved some measure of justice by exposing the villains and their conspiracy.KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON reunites Scorsese with two of his favorite collaborators, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. DiCaprio plays Ernest Burkhart, a WWI veteran who returns to his native Oklahoma after the war and becomes a willing participant in a scheme by his wealthy rancher uncle, William ""King"" Hale to separate their Osage neighbors from their newfound wealth. Hale is played by De Niro as the ultimate hypocrite, who presents himself as a friend to the Osage and a pious pillar of the community, all the while orchestrating schemes to have relatives and associates marry Osage women in order to poison them and inherit their oil rights, along with hiring criminals to simply use a gun whenever that is more convenient. In contrast to these two is Lily Gladstone as Mollie, the Osage woman whom Ernest marries, through her we see the suffering visited on her people. It's a tremendous performance, done often without benefit of a lot of dialogue or showy dramatics, and a contrast to her two male co-stars. DiCaprio's Ernest is a weak man without a moral compass, and his crimes are made worse because we feel he genuinely had affection for his Osage wife, but nevertheless slowly poisoned her anyway with doctored insulin. DiCaprio affects a ""dense face"" expression throughout the film to convey Ernest's character that some viewers might consider an example of ""Big Acting."" We've heard De Niro's Southern accent before, and it is interesting to contrast it, along with DiCaprio's as well, with that of Jesse Plemons, who plays the chief Bureau investigator, who actually hails from Dallas, Texas. It helps that Scorsese cast Gene Jones and Barry Corbin, both of whom were in the Coen Brothers' NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, in small parts. I actually think Corbin would have made a better ""King"" Hale than De Niro, but if you can get one of the greatest working actors alive, you go with him. Brendan Fraser turns up as a loud mouth huckster lawyer, and despite some who said it felt like he was still playing his character from THE WHALE, I think he plays the part perfectly. John Lithgow appears as a prosecutor, and the supporting roles are well cast with actors sporting very distinctive faces, both Osage and White, who look like they could have just stepped out of an old photo from the time.I do think this film is overlong, at a minimum, 45 minutes could have been cut from the running time. I think the pacing suffers because of the length, but to its credit, the final third of the film is its strongest. The screenplay by Scorsese and Eric Roth certainly could have used some tightening up. The cinematography is awesome, and shooting on location in Oklahoma makes the land itself a distinctive character right along with the actors. Nobody is a better visual storyteller than Scorsese. He's not afraid to steal from himself, as several scenes are staged like similar ones in GOODFELLAS.Is KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON on par with RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS, CASINO, or THE DEPARTED? I would say no, the story is too sprawling, and many will find it too grim. There is his patented violence, but here it little resembles the gleeful viciousness of the Italian or Irish Mobs, but I think he does a great job of conveying the cruelty and brutality that was always simmering under the surface in rural America. And I think the film stands as a powerful statement on human nature and its capacity for avarice and the violence it inspires. And whatever the merits of the film, it is a powerful history lesson.Though some were thrown off by the final scene, where the ultimate fates of the principles are revealed, which is usually done with a few terse words on the screen and a photograph, I give Scorsese credit for really doing something different. Having the director himself step up and deliver the final word, is a great note to end on.And whatever money Apple, Scorsese and the rest, make from this film, some of it should find its way back to the Osage Nation at Fairfax, Oklahoma. They've earned it.",positive
568,"It was surprising to me to find the reviews to be objective and critical yet fair on this movie. I actually agreed with most of them. I was expecting to find a herd of right-wing crazies slamming this movie for being too PC but that was not the case. The reviews were pretty accurate. It was a LONG movie but IMO it was certainly worth watching and it was like the Irishman in that you have to watch the characters while they THINK, while they say things without words, with non-verbal communication. Its obvious that many viewers expected instant gratification. I think the genius of these 2 movies, this movie and the Irishman is they make you think outside the box. They make you want to shout ""For the love of God just say it clearly"" but that is the genius, the characters are REAL, they are flawed, they don't communicate effectively. Most movies are too pat, too contrived, this movie and the Irishman most certainly are not predictable, contrived, pat, like the cheap garbage Hollywood is pumping out for the simple-minded fans. You need to THINK to appreciate these movies. You need to get frustrated. And that is the genius in their methods. I like how Scorsese makes you work for the plot, it isn't handed to you like you are some fool that needs an easy story. He makes you feel frustration, sadness, and anger. He makes you think. And that is something most of the trash being pushed out of Hollywood does not do. This was a GREAT movie. It showed how DECENT people suffer at the hands of devious losers. And that is the story of MANY people in America throughout American history. Evil wins most of the time, but there are times when justice is served.",positive
569,"After the Irish man I was looking forward for this one just to enjoy a good directing worth of watch movie. Though a friendly advice to all those critics saying its too long and needs to be shorted, NO ONE FORCE YOU TO WATCH THIS, this is an un acceptable excuse to question the quality of movie and if you got bored with this one then three is a problem with you as it pictured a life not a fantasy rubbish.There are some drawbacks though, De niro played as always not eye catching but still on high level, same as Leo which his face mimic was something new and funny in a way. But this is my view you may find them different.The soundtracks was amazing, the strong story and of course the mastery level of directing are the good points so if you are a true movie nerd try to watch it at least once.",positive
570,"It was a long movie, but didn't drag on and feel long to me. That surprised me because it didn't seem particularly suspenseful or anything.I had trouble believing the way the main characters acted and responded in this movie. Maybe that's what happened in real life, but I still have trouble. The wife was too calm and rational. She just not believable. I think a real person would be much angrier. Maybe she was a saint. Who knows.The husband did bad things but acted like he loved them, but he just went along with doing bad things. I just don't understand. The way he carried himself, I wondered if he was retarted or something. Maybe he was easily suggestible and couldn't stand up for himself. I just don't understand that though. I feel like in real life, he wasn't such a push over and was a lying creep that was also evil. They are making it seem he was evil on accident because he's a passive pushover and that's hard for me to believe. But maybe in his case it was true.What's so heartbreaking on this movie is that these people made friends with and formed bonds with these Native Americans.. The Osage. But, despite that, they killed them anyway. That's the worst kind of murderer. The kind that stabs you in the back.I was surprised the USA government actually helped and did the right thing. I guess I'm used to hearing bad news these days.",positive
571,"Scorsese easily manipulated the minds . There is a dialog at the end of the movie between two main characters ( wife and husband) .Your mind cant find out they were love each other or not .I think whole movie gathered in the scene that these two couples speak with each other .The beauty of this scene is simplicity . Not any mind blowing words . Simple but complex !!!I love the movies with such an end . Like godfather , whole movies gathered in scene of Alpacino dancing with his beloved ones .Unlike other long Scorsese's movies like irishman , this movie is different and I suggest to watch this marvelous movie .",positive
572,"Martin Scorsese, the flagship director of excessively long films, this year raises our cinematic expectations with Killers of the Flower Moon. Maybe too much.His work as a director is impeccable. Even the cinematography and production design are top-notch. That is beyond dispute. The performances are also a prominent part of the film. Di Caprio, De Niro and Gladstone live up to the reputation of their names and the filmmaker who directs them.What prevents this film from being out of my top 10 this year is the script and, undoubtedly, the editing. The first act and the beginning of the second are too slow. There are scenes that clearly could have been shorter, eliminating unnecessary footage. The third act is a completely different movie. The tension rises, the suspense rises, the betrayals rise and what was going to be a great disappointment rises. Luckily it wasn't and the boat could be saved in the last minutes. The montage is discussion material for another topic. I still don't get into the dynamics of long films. For that, do series and that's it.In short, it is a film for movie buffs, due to the names that surround the name, but it is totally skippable if you do not want to avoid a long film that could be quite boring for those looking for high-paced and fast-paced things.",positive
573,"In my years of cinematic experience, accompanied by the insights of esteemed film critics and gifted filmmakers, I've come to appreciate a vast array of storytelling styles. This particular piece, however, felt overly prolonged, extending perhaps three hours beyond its narrative merit. The pacing felt languorous, with sequences that seemed uneventful and dialogues that sometimes veered towards the gratuitous. It's undeniable that the historical backdrop it draws upon is tragic and should be handled with respect. Yet, the cinematic representation seemed more like a financial endeavor than a genuine tribute. Throughout history, many have succumbed to the allure of monetary gain, often at the expense of authenticity. This film, unfortunately, might just be another testament to that. Its cinematography lacked the precision we've come to expect in contemporary cinema. Furthermore, its resolution, or the lack thereof, left much to be desired. I do understand that many viewers might resonate with its emotional theme, but from a strictly cinematic perspective, it felt like it missed its mark.",positive
574,"I read the book in 2017 and Scorcese stays true to the source material. The major difference being that the book has more material on the financial angle of the supposed caretakers of the Osage people.Robert De Niro is the leader of the evil and money hungry pack of thieves with murder in his heart. Leonardo DiCaprio is his equally greedy nephew who marries an Osage woman named Mollie, with rights to the land's oil rich territory.Lily Gladstone is magnificent as Mollie and will most likely win the Oscar for Best Actress. The entire cast shines under the watchful direction of Marty Scorcese. I took off one point for the unnecessary length of over three hours. The credits alone must run ten minutes. It takes a village to work on a Marty production.",positive

576,"In the Lord Of The Rings, J. R. R. Tolkien introduced the Ents, fantasy inspired sentient anthropomorphic creatures in the form of trees which spoke and moved, very, very slooooowly.Whilst watching Martin Scorsese's latest movie, the Ents came to mind, both for Scorsese's perceptive ability and adding soul to his movies, but at the same time take us through a very slow and lengthy linear path as the events in the Killers of the Flower Moon unfold.In the style of a somewhat laid-back narrative approach, not dissimilar to his previous picture, The Irishman, and just as long, Scorsese delivers a worthy epic movie based on true events of a series of sinister conspiratorial murders that took place in the 1920s in Osage, Oklahoma, committed against native Americans and driven by greed, in the oil rich state.Highly sensitive subject, completely unknown to me, and pleased I watched the movie on the big screen.De Niro played De Niro and DiCaprio played a tad below par.PS. I don't think the movie is 10 star worthy, but 1 star ratings by some would seem to be rather inconsiderate.",positive
577,"For some, the Osage murders was the fiery match that lit the bonfire of years of systematic disenfranchisement; for many others, a mere historical footnote. Scorsese's latest film covers a haunting period of the early 20th century where white exploitation of the native Americans of Osage County came to a murderous head. His mobster and quasi-mobster flicks hurtle along in consumerist excess, 2+ hours of dizzying highs and lows, but late-stage Marty has mortality more than anything on his mind; he drip feeds the narrative over three and a half hours, and as we saw in The Irishman, life is slowly squeezed out. Schoonmaker is not shy with punctuating the odyssey with those trademark splatters of violence, each cold and wordless and sudden, but the rest of the narrative is a classic slow burn, methodical and agonising. We feel the gradual suffocation as the wolves close in on the Osage community, with nowhere to turn.It must have been for those in Mollie Kyle's position, who watches as each pillar of her family and community crumble one by one, helpless to halt the genocide. Gladstone wields inertia as her primary weapon: each stony-faced gaze is a peer into a guilty man's soul, and near the film's close, in a defining conversation that once and for all dictates the moral lines that have been drawn, it seems that she knows her husband better than he knows himself. One might only yearn for a clearer explanation for what Gladstone or indeed the historical Kyle ever saw in Burkhart. Was it truly love? Killers of the Flower Moon is a piercing historical excision, but it's still covered by Hollywood gloss, 200 million worth at that. The softening of the protagonist's bloodthirst and collusion is one overt symptom, with DiCaprio's moral quandary twisting and turning over the course of the narrative, his lined face becoming more and more gaunt, contorted in a tangle of guilt and shame. There are still remnants of that heartthrob. Meanwhile, Wikipedia contributors still argue whether the real Burkhart meets the criteria and definition of a serial killer.If that is the price to pay for having this story reach the big screen, then so be it. Scorsese has been producing cautionary tales since the beginning of his career, but you might not recognise that given the hordes of admirers who turn a blind eye to the undercutting endings of Goodfellas or The Wolf of Wall Street (which quite literally call out and to the audience). The Irishman deconstructed that power fantasy over three and a half hours, the cinematic equivalent of a fizzling firecracker, a pathetic denouement that observes Frank Sheeran forgotten and fading out in a nursing home. William Hale is the straight villain here, the white supremacist who orchestrates the Osage conspiracy, almost plain in his ruthlessness. It's a role De Niro could have played in his sleep. There's a sequence early on that is vintage Scorsese à la Copacabana: the camera tracks DiCaprio as he arrives by train in Gray Horse, follows the automobile as they drive out to the Hale ranch, and, as the theatre is drenched in an intoxicating fusion of tribal percussion and bass-heavy blues rock, glides overhead to reveal the plains punctured with countless oil rigs. The contagion has begun. But the visual flourishes and slow motion tableus are far and few between, and Scorsese's restraint is evident for much of the rising action, so to speak. See the more subtle work he does with eyelines and silent gazes; watch how he shoots a POV shot of Gladstone disembarking a train, making it feel as if the entire county is scrutinising her small fortune and waiting to pounce. Watch Scorsese balance brutality with delicate moments where the Osage women find solace with their culture, as with the wordless passing of Lizzie Q. But is the final shot enough of a cultural legacy?Nearly every Scorsese film has been, more or less, about his Catholicism and inherently lingering guilt. Silence felt like the culmination of a entire lifetime, a story that must and will continue to grow in estimation as his most personal movie. Killers of the Flower Moon is as taut of a thriller as any of his dramas, and yet the penultimate scene deflates this tension by pulling back to a true crime-esque radio play, a goofy, flash-forward re-enactment of the Osage Indian murders complete with exaggerated foley effects and a sponsorship from Lucky Strikes. The choice is deliberately anachronistic and anti-climactic, a tone-jarring switch after the impending justice that had been accumulated and promised to the audience in the final hour, and initially it plays as an avoidance of dealing sincerely with the subject matter's historical baggage. After all, how can a Hollywood flick ever capture a true sense of what the Osage community suffered and still endure? Scorsese knows his film cannot, only zoom into a forgotten atrocity and hope it doesn't become resigned to a historical footnote. There was no closure for them, much less in a commercial retelling. In conducting his research for the film, Scorsese met with the Gray Horse community to discuss their concerns about representation and the unearthing of trauma, aiming to avoid a retread of past exploitation, and ended up rewriting portions of the script to better incorporate their culture. To lend those voices an avenue to speak was a great privilege, he describes. He plays himself as the final narrator, admitting his complicity and asking that the audience consider this for themselves. That he can humble himself at the age of 81 and continue to challenge and re-invent his craft over five decades shows a remarkable consciousness about the power, both to adovcate and undermine, of filmmaking. He knows the story isn't his to tell, but it still needs to be told, and that is as meaningful of a tribute to Mollie Kyle as there could be.",positive
578,"Martin Scorsese visits yet another homework on us eager viewers, to over analyze and scrutinize cause, just watching this and enjoying the story is not in the cards. The dreary setting, unappealing lead characters, story of perils few can relate, because those who could are long gone. Whom is it for? Sad tale of greed, gluttony, envy and probably much more. Alas it sucked my will to live long before I could catch anything else. The cast play impeccably, every scene is captivating thanks to actors transformation into characters they play: you revile one and pity the other, all the while thinking when will this end.",positive
579,"""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" the latest offering from Martin Scorsese, delivers a narrative that, in my opinion, surpasses its book counterpart. The film's approach to storytelling, focusing more on character development than simply presenting a barrage of facts and testimonies, gives it a more compelling edge. However, despite its strengths, it doesn't quite live up to the high expectations set by some reviewers.In many ways, this film echoes the sentiments I had with ""The Irishman"" - another Scorsese creation that, while ambitious, struggled with its lengthy runtime. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" also tends to feel overextended. Prolonged scenes, often filled with nothing but the hum of passing automobiles and brief dialogues, create a sense of silence that pervades much of the movie. This underutilization of sound and music is a missed opportunity. A more dynamic soundtrack and impactful sound effects could have significantly enhanced the viewing experience, maintaining tension and engaging the audience more effectively.The film does pick up its pace in the second half, drawing more interest as the plot unfolds. However, this momentum doesn't fully make up for the earlier sluggishness. And then there's the ending. It feels incomplete, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction. The story, rich in potential, seems to conclude without delivering a truly fulfilling resolution.In summary, while ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a step up from its literary source, offering a more character-driven and engaging narrative, it falls short of the cinematic excellence we know Scorsese is capable of. A tighter edit and a more strategic use of sound could have elevated this film to the heights it had the potential to reach.",positive
580,"Killers of the Flower Moon portrays a horrific true story about greed and murder. I was shocked by the events and dismayed by how long these crimes went uninvestigated. I was particularly impressed by Lily Gladstone, who is able to show off a range of acting talents. And Leonardo DiCaprio plays his role of Ernest Burkhart in a way that makes him both sympathetic and despicable. That being said, I feel like no one is able to tell Martin Scorsese no these days, and so he just leaves in everything he wants and doesn't feel the need to trim things down. It's a solid film, bogged down by the runtime.",positive
581,"I watched it at home with a few short breaks at 150% speed, So I can't say what the experience would be watching it in the theater or at normal speeds. For me it was a very good movie. At no point was I bored. There's can be a downside to following books and true stories as closely as possible. For me it's not a problem, but it's hilarious to see all these people complaining how long and boring it was. If they had shortened it to 2 hours you'd have a bunch of people complaining how much they cut and how much they changed the story. Instead, they followed it as faithfully as possible and now we have a bunch of people complaining it's too long and boring.",positive
582,"First of all I must say that I don't write reviews often. I respect Martin Scorcese highly, so it is hard for me to write the following, but nonetheless has to be said. This film is 2 hours too long and it's fantastically boring. In fact, during the many sessions (took over a week) needed to finish the film (I cannot fathom anyone sitting through its entirety in cinema - and this from a person who saw Dune 2 twice), the same thought kept coming back: Why did he do it? My interpretation is that it was the result of white mans guilt; a burning desire to enlighten and to deliver cinematic justice to the Native Americans, who suffered so much but in the end really only ending up tormenting the audience. Many are the times, that uneven films have been saved in editing, but here it seems that everyone involved must have been pressed to not question the man and just deliver - over the top. There is so much that isn't up to the usual standards and it is simply not possible that postproduction and producers could have thought it was a great film. I pray that Marty comes to his senses and realise what he has done. I also hope that he can separate his guilt tormenting him from the film making process. And I'm also very sorry to even write this review..Scores 6 and not 5, because Leo and Bob are still fantastic despite everything.Peace.",positive
583,"Had to be the worst picture I've ever seen. What is all the hype about anyways ? Acting was beyond horrible and really should've been condensed into a 15 minute cartoon. Waiting 2 hours for anything to happen . I only exciting thing in this whole movie was by the mysterious owl. Hard to even watch ..and it just dragged on and on with nothing ever getting done or said. Just a pitiful display of an over budgeted Hollywood SNOOZEFEST. Knew right from the beginning , Dinero was the culprit...Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this monster of a mess out. Save yourself the pain and agony...and PASS !",positive
584,"With Scorsese's presentation of this material as of its time, I thought it would be interesting if he had taken the added step of throwing in an actual intermission in the middle of the running time of this film.Alas, even without a break of any sort, this movie runs smoothly enough if you pace yourself.The look, style and not to mention the performances and direction of this production keep your eyes and mind occupied enough throughout.Portrayed on screen is truly an American tragedy. Absolutely.It is difficult and sad to witness.There are so many stars here but I enjoyed the roles of lessers:
Musicians Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson and Jack White. Yes! Look them up if you don't know.The legendary and always great Barry Corbin, Gene Jones.Batting cleanup in the final hour were John Lithgow and Brendan Fraser.But the biggest star is Lily Gladstone and also Cara Jade Myers who plays her sister, Anna.Wow. Both of them. Incredible.Lastly, Ty Mitchell who plays John Ramsey. Just perfect.This should be seen on the big screen with not as many interruptions as one might have at home.You won't see many more films better than this in 2023.",positive
585,"Too complicated. Everything begins when in 1920 oil is found in the Osage Nation land in Oklahoma. The situation is a bit mysterious when the Osage people begin to be murdered one after one by the whites of course. This despite the fact that there are important interracial marriages when some white men marry Osage girls. Murders happen also in these mixed families although by personal motives based on material wealth greed. The parts are greatly performed by excellent actors and actresses such as Leonardo DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart, Lily Gladstone as Moliie Burkhart and Robert De Niro as William Hale. Mollie and Ernest fell in love with each other and get married. Mollie is an Osage and Ernest a white man. A excellent movie to be seen.",positive
586,"I just finished reading the book before watching this movie, so I knew what was going to happen. That may have dampened my enthusiasm somewhat but I do think this is a worthy telling of this history. De Niro does a great job of inhabiting Hale, the definition of a wolf in sheep's clothing. One issue I have though is in real life he is at least 20 years older than Hale was. The runtime is 3 hours and 20 minutes, but it doesn't feel that long. I watched it over several days, though, so your mileage may vary. I did like how they wrapped the story with the radio broadcast and who they got to read the last part.",positive
587,"Very Scorsese film. I loved it. The case is just right - slow, but not tedious, constant throughout the movie, still a lot of things happening and also you have to rethink what you saw in the light of new discoveries, so you are never bored. The actors are superb, especially Leo and Lily and they have great chemistry, only from their glances you see they feel in love with each other. I really like Scorsese way of using very few words, but trough the play of the actors and the setting saying so much. From the first scene with his uncle, although nothing much is said you get the feeling that this man is planing something not good. Also I liked the slightly slurred way they talked, it brings a bit of past authenticity, but is not so much that you cannot understand. The time period is very well handled - the way its filmed, decor and all bring the epoch very much to life. Finally the real footage from the riots is a very good touch - connecting with the theme of the movie and reminding us that such things are happening to all oppressed and restricted communities.",positive
588,"Say you start up an AppleTV+ 7-day free trial , and you watch this movie for less than 30 minutes each day in a row. Your 7-day trial will run out before you get to finish this movie! It is that long! But I still give it decent enough stars because it is well-made and packed with superstars: 3 Best Actor Oscar winners, then Oscar nominees John Lithgow, Jesse Plemmons, and new A-lister Lily Gladstone, who does such a good job. This is an important story in our history to tell, and acclaimed director Martin Scorsese clearly fully dives into it, making sure to get all the nuances of the structure dynamics and relationships, all the way to the birth of the FBI.",positive
589,"This film is not a sprint, it is a hike through a turbulent setting. Dicaprio playing the role of a Good for Nothing Husband is a role we haven't seen him do. No matter how wicked and vile his character is there is always an essence of competency but not in Killers of the Flower Moon. The cast is top-tier, and the story is heavy and uncomfortable perfect for what it is telling. The wardrobe is amazing. My biggest issue was the score early in the film, it's loud and unnecessary and is often fighting the dialogue for the audience's attention. 8/10 would recommend it to anyone who likes a classic western.",positive
590,"From all the buzz around the movie and the initial critics and audience ratings, I was honestly expecting a much better movie than this.So first of all, the story here is an important one, and one that had to have a movie made about it finally to shine some light on it and let more people know about it. This is a very tragic story and it definitely deserves a 3-hour movie made about it, but maybe not this movie.Probably the biggest problem I have with this movie is that it is emotionally distant. I have no emotional attachment to any of the characters and don't really care about them. Sure, I feel bad about Mollie and what she goes through in this movie, but that's just that, feeling bad for her, nothing more. We don't get to know these Indian characters well and before you know it they're gone. So there's not much you know enough about them personally to care that much. It's more of an observation and it's like watching a documentary, than characters with depth and enough screen time for you to feel emotionally attached to them.And if this is a deliberate choice on Marty's part here, I can respect that, but it's just not my cup of tea. I care more about movies where I can understand their characters and feel close to them and have an emotional attachment to them. Plot and message are important, but characterization and good characters are as important if not more important than the plot and story.Everything else in this movie from the technical point is great obviously, except for some sound-mixing issues and obvious voiceovers which make you wonder why they didn't just redo the scene instead. The editing is pretty good and is reminiscent of Goodfellas, thematically too. The acting is obviously great, and the movie looks gorgeous and it's nice to see some actual color and good lighting here for a change.What I also think doesn't help the fact that this movie isn't as interestingly told as it could've been, is the focus on DiCaprio's character. I understand and respect what Marty was trying to do here, but I think I would've liked it way more if it also focused on the Indian characters as well. I read that the story was supposed to be told from the FBI's perspective but it was changed to Ernest Burkhart's perspective and him being the lead character. I don't really have a problem with this perspective as it shows how this foreigner comes to this land and slowly ruins everything. It also serves a great purpose of showing the blunt reality of how uncool, ungangster, and pathetic these people are. I really like that about Scorsese's movies that he doesn't really care about showing his main character in a good like or to make them look cool and all that, and just shows what they really are.But the problem is that the movie is over 3 hours, and the first 2 hours is not really that interesting, and when you thought it got interesting when the FBI finally comes into the picture, it doesn't really get much more interesting either. It would've been way better if we also were shown the Indian characters and they got their characterization side by side with our protagonist. Even if it was told from the FBI's perspective, it would've had intrigue and mystery about it and would've made the story more interesting. I think that's a deliberate choice of showing the events play out nonchalantly and straightforwardly, but as I said, this style is not really my cup of tea and would've rather had a script that focused on the Indian characters and made me care about them.The movie is also over 3 hours which I don't really have a problem with and I don't think it was boring either. Yeah, the pacing is slow at times and I can understand people getting bored with it and thinking the movie is too long, which I don't they're wrong either. I personally don't really have a problem with longer movies, but like I said, this movie's pacing and runtime would've benefited a lot from a more interesting storytelling and perspective.I also love the way with how they ended the movie instead of your generic and cliché text on screen that is so typical with these kind of movies.Nonetheless, it is still a pretty good movie and a movie that everyone should see at least once because it has a really important story. It definitely could've condensed into a much shorter movie, because I think there could've been more interesting stuff happening in the first 2 hours than what we got. I don't really care for its characters since I have no emotional attachment to any of them, but I can see people liking this movie more for the very same reason I don't. And I can see why people would give this movie 8s, 9s, and 10s because of its tragic story and the message it brings into the light, but I personally don't think a movie should be judged by just one aspect of it and say it's a 10/10 because it had a nice message and doesn't really matter if the characterization isn't that great and etc.So overall, it's a well-made movie but a long one, and it deserves a watch, but the characterization just doesn't tickle my fancy.",positive
591,"An absolute triumph in film. Martin Scorsese made a deep, dark, emotional, and thoughtful film when he made this. Lily Gladstone and DeCaprio made it in terms of acting; but hell, the entire supporting cast was great (Even the smaller appearances from Fraser and Plemmons).Finding an absolutely great film, one that surpasses all expectations with its writing, its story, its heart, is very rare. The runtime definitely scares some people, but honestly I would've stayed for another hour and a half. But the absolute cruelty that the Osage faced from Hale and Erckhardt is insane. The loss of life, this completely and utterly tragic event was somehow... forgotten.With the situation our country is in right now; concerning people being persecuted by a larger (whiter) authoritarian figure, this does sadly prove that a lot of evil goes unpunished in this country, and even the slight chance that it makes an impact, it is small and forgotten. Never forget the lives that were lost. Never forget you, and your people's stories. At the first ten minutes of this film; the dialogue was already too real and too brutal, even for today.Thank God for Martin Scorsese.",positive
592,"I like long movies, but 3 & 1/2 hours was ridiculous!I appreciate the sad story, but they did not half to make it so draggy and redundant at times. We get that Ernest didn't talk throughout a long interrogation, but we didn't need to see it all. Then he was gonna testify and King talked him out of it, but then in the end, he did. I'm glad Molly recovered from the poisioning and drama of her almost dying. It was just too prolonged like everything belse in the movie.DiNiero was very good as he is in everything. DiCaprio was just too angry looking as he is in everything lately. Lilly Gladstone was just okay. Not Oscar worthy in my opinionWhile it was an interesting story, I can't see people these days sitting still for 3 &1/2 hours in a theater! I watched it on streaming and was happy I could pause it when it got too tedious.I am certainly glad Oppenheimer won best picture as it was such a much better movie.",positive
593,"I am a fan of Scorsese and liked most of his movies but Killers of the Flower Moon was not one of Scorsese's better movies. It was way too long for the amount of story, it could have been 1:30 hours long and still tell the same story. I'm not generally against long movies and I enjoyed the Irishman a lot though it had almost the same running time. The story and the characters were very predictable from the get go. The characters were stereotypical, very white or very dark without anything that would make them interesting or nuanced. The story had no twists and turns and was even repetitive at some points. The factual story behind the film was actually way more interesting than the film itself and I think a director/screen writer with better story telling techniques could have made a far more engaging film with the material. For a movie that was about murder, there was absolutely no suspense within the story to keep you engaged for 3 hours.I don't think it was worth my money and time.",positive
594,"Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a great movie. Echoes of The Godfather, The Grifters, Manon du Source, High Plains Drifter and so much else. It's long but it doesn't drag and there's a tone change in the third act.De Niro masterfully plays ""King"" William Hale, the patriarch of a wealthy family and apparent benefactor of many good causes of Osage County, Oklahoma who is also responsible for some horrible things. Lily Gladstone does a masterful job playing a young Osage woman, one of many in her tribe who have become wealthy from the discovery of oil on their tribal lands. She gives a quiet and understated performance of a native woman who falls for a rogue ""coyote"" young white man who may or may not really love her. Leo DeCaprio has what may be the hardest role as that (not so) young man, fresh back from WWI who returns to Osage Country when called for by Hale.",positive
595,"If this doesn't win, then Oscars is a joke. Maybe it's already a joke (they nominated Tar last year). Lol. But, this is a MUST win!!Scorsese starts the movie with a brief personal intro. He loves this story and that is why he made it. His LOVE shows in the movie. It's 3.5 hours because it's a REAL story or stories. As much as it is a historical movie, it is a mystery. You're trying to figure out who is who and what side are they on? Even with Leo's character, you kinda really don't 100% know where he is. Yes, there's love, but there's more. I wish they put a little more into explaining why he chose his uncle's side at times. It was a little unclear. Either way, it didn't matter. His love for his wife and kids is what mattered more.Besides being a great love story, it shows great real history. It's eye-opening to see how things were for the Osage. More amazing is how Mollie and her soul led the Osage.",positive
596,"I pretty much agree with the great writer Paul Schrader (TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL) when he asserts that Martin Scorcese's KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON (2023) should have stuck to the book with Leo DiCaprio playing the role of FBI Agent Tom White as he ""would have preferred Leonardo DiCaprio to play the role of the cop in 'Killers of the Flower Moon' rather than the role of the idiot. Spending three-and-a-half hours in the company of an idiot is a long time.""I'm sympathetic with Scorsese's intentions - to make this a tale more about the people of the Osage Nation, those who bore the brunt of these terrible crimes - but even in his reworked script, none of the Osage have any real agency in the plot. Lily Gladstone is wonderful in the role of Mollie but her character is physically tortured and subverted in every attempt to gain traction towards helping solve the crimes against her people.We are still left watching DiCaprio's dim-witted Ernest Burkhart, World War I veteran, petty armed robber, and wastrel, guessing at how deeply he will be mired in the evil of his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). It was hard not to look at this film without noting its fascination with the machinations of crime, the trademark of many of Martin Scorcese's greatest films, though in this one he indicts the whole white community of Oklahoma rather than the Italian community of GOODFELLAS or CASINO, and the organized crime of FLOWERS looks cheap and petty, more like THE SOPRANOS with their thin veneer of class built on sleaze and thuggery than the flashy lights and nostalgia-tinted lens tipped towards the Scorcese films. I hated Burkhart but I was forced to root for him, as at least he was acting with agency, trying to save his neck and his family.FLOWER MOON is a well-made film and a very good one, but it is overlong. My attention wandered in the final 45 minutes or so, as it seemed the cards were all down on the table but we, the audience, were forced to watch a point-by-point retelling of the grim events for the trial of the miscreants involved, after having already witnessed it being played out. I felt like the radio-play of the finale could have covered some of these elements in a more concise fashion.",positive
597,This surprised me I thought was Absolutely brilliant excellent performances by Dicaprio & De Niro cinematography was fantastic the story was very well Executed about the Osage Murders in Oklahoma during the 1920s despite the 206 Minutes runtime it doesn't feel like it you get so involved in the story When I watched it at the cinema I was Gripped on the edge of my seat if you loved Scorsese's Other movies like taxi Driver mean streets The wolf of Wall Street the Departed and any other movie from Scorsese's Filmography you will like this Absolutely brilliant Movie Excellent Performances watch it.,positive
598,"The film is very calm, stable and slow. It's much, much longer than it should be.The topic is perfect, the events are well organised. The acting, especially that of Leonardio Dicaprio, is first class. But this does not save the film.Uncle Hale's intrigues are very striking. Robert de Niro also plays very well. However, in a film that progresses at a turtle speed, these are deflated.The film dramatically conveys the drama of the American Indians of a period. But a warmth is missing...I expected a more fluid, more striking film from Martin Scorsese. Not this time. That's my opinion.I hope I have not been unfair to the actors and the director.",positive
599,"I haven't watched a lot of Scorsese movies. I can't say I'm his fan even though I know his position in cinema history. Still, I went in with high expectations given his name. It was such a mesmerizing experience that I didn't write a single note during the film of 3.5 hours.The reasons I loved it were numerous. The story was fascinating, the de Niro and Leo did their things, and the score was amazing. Most importantly, it somehow managed to hold onto my fragmented attention for 3.5 hours and a large part of that comes from Scorsese's direction and how the movie is put together. He's reached a point in his craft where he cannot fail as his senses are just incredibly sharp. It's hard to put into words. One cannot avoid comparing this movie to a recent historical movie made by Nolan, Oppenheimer. I thought that this movie was superior to Oppenheimer, largely because of pacing. Oppenheimer felt too maximalist at times trying to pack the whole story into 3 hours while KFM was more relaxed in the pacing, feeling less dense and tiresome by the end of it. It had a much better pace in my opinion with roughly the same amount of story to tell.KFM also tells a story about greed to an unimaginable level. It's such an interesting story in history because we are always seeing indigenous people in the lesser position. The minority, the discriminated. However, this story is far more disturbing because of the details of the racial power play at hand. The Osage people had wealth but they were still under the influence of an even more powerful and sinister man such as Will Hale (Robert de Niro). His years of kindness and service to the community and his cold-bloodedness for money juxtapose for the entire movie and bring on a tension that is extremely discomforting. This was a one chance where the indigenous people had a fair game against the white men and their arrogance, assimilation and ambition but even then, they faced a wall too evil. It's a disturbing story at its core and that's what made the movie so great.I could also see Scorsese's respect to the Osage people and I can't remember the last time I saw a movie of this scale that didn't have some sort of controversy about its portrayal of indigenous people. Its ending also showed respect as it suggested that these ""true crime"" stories are not just for our entertainment and it involves real people with real consequences still felt to this very day. It only happened a 100 years ago but it highlighted a very dark history of America. It was cinema at its finest level with very little to criticize.",positive
600,"Martin's narrative is somewhat tense, one doesn' ecactly know what is going to happen inside a scene, what reactions are going to take place. Scorsese is a son of his generation and the techniques used were learned from his masters and his mates of generation, the brats. That's why Martin pays tribute to the American cinema and the Eurpean cinema, but also makes reference to Brian De Palma (circular travelling, snooping camera, high angle shots & an overhead shot at the end of the film) and his companions.The plot is critical with the cruelty of the whites and the wasps focusing on a case of several murders in an Amerindian community.The film ends with a fantastic homage to the RADIO.",positive
601,"There was only one thing preventing me from expecting Killers of The Flower Moon to be a full blown master work and it's that I didn't really like the book it's based on that much. I read it because I was so excited for this movie and I was bitterly disappointed in how much a chore to get through it was. It was just so devoid of any real perspective or style but I obviously knew Scorsese was gonna bring that to a film adaption in abundance. I throw this term around very rarely and I can honestly say that Killers of The Flower Moon was a 100% masterpiece.The film takes such an interesting approach to this story that it's never not totally riveting and investing. Telling this story from Ernest Burkhart's perspective could've gone very wrong since he can be quite reprehensible as a character but his arc is just so well executed and realised that it just works. All the scenes between DiCaprio and De Niro got under my skin in all the right ways and they raised this film beyond just being a standard mystery or procedural.It's been well documented that the film was initially going come from the viewpoint of the FBI agent character played by Jesse Plemons and play out as more of a crime/mystery thriller. While I'm sure that version would have been an interesting watch, telling it from the view of the perpetrators adds a whole other level of emotional complexity and rich character drama to the point where almost every scene in this movie could've been it's own short film because there's just always so much going on under the surface and I cannot wait to watch it for a second time for that reason.Leonardo DiCaprio honestly gives one of his best performances in a totally against type role for him. It might sound cheesy to say he disappeared into this character but it really does feel like the only was to accurately describe just how good he is in this movie. He plays such a spineless and easily manipulated person in a way that I couldn't have possibly imagined and the fact that it's so far from what we usually see from him is why I think it's one of his best roles.Robert De Niro plays this Angel of Death type role in such natural and non-cartoony way that it just makes his character come across as all the more evil and I love the fact that we don't learn much about his back story. It would've diluted De Niro's portrayal and made him just that bit more threatening and mysterious as a result.Despite hearing non stop acclaim about Lily Gladstone, I was still amazed at just how incredible a performance she gave. She's basically the heart of the whole movie and she portrays such a wealth of emotions behind her very often blank expression that it's a masterwork to behold any scene that she's in. Her and DiCaprio's chemistry was unbelievable and I can't wait to see her in more roles.Scorsese does what is so important with this type of story and takes a very difficult subject matter and makes it captivating as a viewing experience. It's a western, a twisted love story, crime thriller and courtroom drama all infused into one and despite the atrocities being committed on screen I was never not interested in what was happening.I won't go as far as to say that the 3 and a half hour runtime flew by, you do feel the length but it's a very deliberately paced film and I can honestly say I was never bored and there wasn't a single scene or moment that was wasted. It's constantly building and building to a crescendo and the fact that the film takes its time to reach its character beats makes the pay offs all the more perfectly realised. The final 30 minutes have more gut punches that I could count and I was genuinely floored by the time it came to an end.Despite all the talent that this film has on display I'm still in shock at just how incredible Killers of The Flower Moon turned out to be. The slow pace and long runtime never bothered me once because of just how invested I was and more importantly than that I was always excited to see where it was going to go next. It doesn't matter how interesting or important the story is if it's not presented in a gripping way and I truly believe this was the best possible way to portray these events and characters. As of now it's my number one of year, maybe even the decade so far, and I'd be amazed if anything else dethroned it.",positive
602,"After all of the hubbub I was expecting a torturous 210 minutes, but the movie was fine. It's evenly paced, and I understand Scorsese's reasoning for it being so long. I just think he was a little too close to the product to see where it could be cut down.The bigger issue I had with this film was that Scorsese just sort of made the same movie again. The book, as I understand, doesn't really have a narrative structure and just recounts the story using meticulous research. That gave Scorsese the opportunity to write his own narrative structure and he simply used his standard: Guy comes up in a criminal organization, does well, police get involved, everything falls apart. Goodfellas, Casino, hell even Wolf of Wall Street had that same basic structure.I will say though, this is probably my favorite Scorsese movie since The Aviator. He hasn't been at his best lately, a lot of his dialogue is just awful. Like Brendan Fraser? That's not Fraser's fault, Scorsese was directing him it's his job to get a good performance. If he wanted him to talk like a kid playing the boss in a school play, he nailed it. I would have liked to see a little more development to the relationship of Ernest and Molly, and a lot less of the death scenes.I liked it, and if you're on the fence I recommend giving it a shot. I did manage to take it in one sitting though I did pause it for like 10 minutes.",positive
603,"I have sat through my fair share of long movies, and slow movies too. I don't mind an arty film or a gritty reality. This however, was endless.3.5 hours of my life taken by the promise of another Scorsese masterpiece, which this absolutely is not.Clearly no one thought to edit this movie at all, they just left everything in.Even the great soundtrack can't redeem hours of endless drudgery with no real direction.The odd gunshot or explosion is overwhelmingly loud in contrast to the downbeat never-ending dialogue. Almost as it they know you need waking up every so often.They don't even try to build the characters or see them develop in any way. You feel almost no connection to your them, not sure if any are villains or heroes or just there for the sake of it.Tropes are plentiful both of white and non white characters and the Klan seems to be there for no reason at all, other than to make an appearance? But none of this seems to serve any real purpose.By the time the plot starts to move at all, if you would call it that, you are already desperate for it to end. The last 90 mins, which could easily have been 45/60 mins were vaguely intriguing.",positive
604,"Story: really showed depth tho the 3.5 hour runtime remains unjustifiable. The plot is simple but captivating, especially when you consider it is a historical. The characters have enough ( if not abundant ) screentime to express their deepest features (inner traits, thoughts,etc).Cinematography: top-notch
Editing: relatively old-schooled. Slowpaced but ensured
Acting: De Niro shows his typical gangster menace. Leo is convincingly dumb -in a good way, sometimes he is hilarious with that pouting face. Gladstone. FREAKING. SHINES. (oscars would be a close call for her and emily blunt - Oppenheimer)
Score: unsettling feels that will display energy of fear and greed (quite similar to dunkirk)",positive
605,"It is perfect. It is like finishing a book within 3hour 30m. Every page 's particular moments are timidly presented. Every single emotion , feels. The sudden guilt after guilt feels absolutely gut wrenching. The ending feels powerful even when the director appeared & announced,""there was no mention of the murders""Humanity killing humans. The most heinous, arrogant act you could ever pull. Linear,much more poignantly presented Story. Every camera angle, duration of each shot is perfect. I can't say about Netflix generation,IT JUST NOT MADE FOR YOU . DO SOD OFF , i guess .But, I FOUND THIS PERFECT.Marty's 80 . This is his best . And i don't think a book based on Indian people could have been adopted into a cinema by any other directors. I bet the editor of this film is a fine director himself,so is the cinematographer,the sound designer & some actors too. It was that good.This cinema was that good.In other words it feels like the mixture of Wolf of wall Street & The Lawrence of Arabia. The tidbit of the departure & J. E. Hoover.Powerful , would be an understatement.Some of the screenshots from this film are piece of art.",positive
606,"""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" directed by Martin Scorsese, is an ambitious adaptation of David Grann's non-fiction book that dives into a dark chapter of American history. Despite its compelling narrative and strong performances, the film occasionally struggles with pacing and cohesion.**Plot and Characters**
Set in the 1920s, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" explores the sinister murders of Osage Nation members in Oklahoma, whose lands were rich with oil. The story unfolds through the eyes of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his marriage to Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), an Osage woman. Robert De Niro delivers a chilling performance as William Hale, Ernest's uncle and the orchestrator of the crimes. DiCaprio and Gladstone's chemistry adds emotional depth to the story, with Gladstone particularly standing out in her portrayal of a woman caught in a web of betrayal and greed.**Direction and Style**
Scorsese's direction is meticulous, capturing the period's atmosphere with stunning cinematography and attention to detail. The film's visual storytelling is rich and immersive, transporting viewers to the heart of the Osage Nation's tragedy. However, the film's length and deliberate pacing can make it feel sluggish at times, detracting from its overall impact.**Themes and Impact**
""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a powerful exploration of systemic racism, greed, and the exploitation of Indigenous peoples. Scorsese handles these themes with sensitivity, shedding light on a lesser-known part of American history. The film's narrative is both haunting and poignant, though it sometimes falters in maintaining a consistent tone.**Conclusion**
While ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a compelling and important film, its pacing issues and uneven storytelling prevent it from reaching its full potential. Nevertheless, the film's strong performances and historical significance make it a worthy watch. Scorsese's commitment to bringing this dark chapter to the screen is commendable, earning the film a respectable 7 out of 10.For those interested in a deep, historical drama with strong acting and a powerful message, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is an engaging, albeit imperfect, cinematic experience.",positive
607,"This re-writes a narrative of First Nations people, Beautifully filmed. Top class acting. Reminds me of Days of Heaven. Leonardo is fantastic. Robert De Niro plays a bit too type. I think the ending is a surprise. What will we do when directors like Scorcese are no longer on the scene. The supporting cast is one of the best of American and British actors ever. This is the 2023 Oscar winner for Best Picture. Di Caprio for best actor along with De Niro. Bernstein with Bradley Cooper is the only competition. The lead actress will be nominated, mark my words. I would love to think that Scorcese has more ideas and plans for more film like this.",positive
608,It's an important story that everyone should read or watch. This film does lack the suspense that would have made it a more interesting movie. At the very beginning of the film you know Ernest Burkhart was in on the murders. I think it would have been more interesting if the viewer was left in the dark until the end regarding his involvement. This also made me doubt the love he had for Mollie. Another thing that bothered me about the film was how Mollie was clueless until the very end. Maybe it was because the audience knew what was going on that made it more difficult to understand why she didn't start to suspect her husband was in on all these murders. Even after Ernest was arrested she still stood by him and didn't make the connection between her getting ill and the injections he was giving her. It could have been a much better movie but I still think it is worth watching.,positive
609,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"", seamlessly weaves together a gripping storyline, stellar performances, and breathtaking visuals. The film's meticulous attention to historical detail and its ability to capture the essence of the source material make it a compelling and thought-provoking experience. Leonardo DiCaprio and the entire cast deliver standout performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters. Director Martin Scorsese's vision is evident in every frame, creating a haunting yet beautiful narrative that stays with you long after the credits roll. Killers of the Flower Moon is a must-watch, showcasing the power of storytelling in the hands of true director.",positive
610,"Scorcese commonly makes gangster films, and this film too centers around two morally bankrupt men. The portrayal of the Osage tribe was very generous as they were shown to be very prosperous while blending their traditions and culture with American capitalism. However, the white man comes along in the shape of Ernest Burkhart played by Leo DiCaprio and he systematically kills every member of his wife's family to ultimately profit from her inheritance. The Indian tribe was shown as vigilant while trying to find out who was causing this madness while the perpetrators are in front of them the whole time. This makes the film a creative re-envisioning of how Native Americans have been often exploited by Americans. The takeaway ultimately becomes that wicked and corrupt men will do anything to gain money.",positive
611,"I'm still feeling the impact of this movie days later -- bitter, brokenhearted, exasperated. LDC is at his best once again (felt slightly sorry for his character and deeply frustrated at his cowardice) DeNiro, with impeccable skill, makes you absolutely hate his insidious community/family influence. And best of all, Lily Gladstone. It was as if she played several characters all by herself in this depiction... her eyes alone should earn an AA. Her tragically, lovingly, suspiciously long piercing gazes and her vocal silences... WOW!Very little stereotypical background music in this movie, instead Osage rhythms and singing. Acts of violence are swift, breath-taking, and dramatic! Story is laced with bigotry, extravagance and corruption of white people pitted against the Osage people, particularly and personally focusing on Molly (Gladstone), who deeply loved Ernest while he was slowly poisoning her and helping with the systematic killing of her entire family... true stories -- double-WOW!This is now one of my top two period pieces of all time!",positive
612,"I am starting to see an Apple signature on their movies. It is almost like they assembled an amateur movie team that was the washed up iphone team. They need to hire GREAT MOVIE experts with decades of cinematic excellence... then figure out how to execute!Overall a great story, but why so long? I could easily send over some edit ideas and I have no movie background.Why does it have to feel so unnatural the entire time? Like I feel like I am watching a movie rather than being submersed in the story line... I should not even noticing the acting or the scenes. If I am there witnessing history, why not make it feel more natural. Not sure why the apple folks have a way to make things feel unrealistic.Sometimes Leo is just trying too hard. Please keep it simple. De Niro played much natural because you believe his character the most. Do not over complicate the characters because they are not as complex as one may think. Leo does not have to over exaggerate his character for cinematic accolades. Just being the natural simple character would be better. Look at De Niro as good example... he does not get all wrapped up in his head to play the role. Keep it simple but polished and believable.",positive
613,"This movie was so long that I was playing Chess on my phone because I was out with friends and family. I couldn't walk out. I really would have liked to know more about the American history and how they affected the natives. They were obscene criminals, but this could've been shown in a more tactful way covering more history having more native characters having more story and more drama. There was none of it. There was one simple, straightforward storyline that continued for three hours and twenty six minutes. The only time I looked up on the screen was when the actress appeared, because she was the most genuine thing in the whole movie. I am so mad that I wasted my precious time on this I'd rather watch a documentary and learn a lot more. Martin is overrated. The other reviews are bought.",positive
614,"Having previously read the story, DiCaprio's portrayal of Ernest Burkhart and Gladstone's portrayal of Mollie Burkhart were excellent. Certainly worth a look by the Academy for Oscar nominations. De Niro is, well, De Niro - he has the magic to make his characters believable. The pleasant surprise was Jesse Plemons' portrayal of Tom White, who in real life was a towering, street smart investigator. For a 3-1/2 hour movie, there were no boring segments. Scorsese poured his heart into this movie. This was a story that needed to be told, and Scorsese is one of best story tellers; he is deserving of an Oscar nomination.",positive
615,"Great film, the storytelling really makes you emotionally connected, or rather invested in the characters. It is slow at points, but nothing feels like it is padding. Phenomenal performances from all actors involved.Act1 does a great job of setting the scene and building the environment, some interesting cinematography aswell and great use of sound work, act 2 is where it slows, more character development and storytelling, this is definitely the most meaty phase, and what makes you invested in the characters, act 3 is a lot more action packed, everything you have been waiting for comes together.Just didnt cut back enough, needed 20 minutes at least less.",positive
616,"The first 2.5 hours are kind of fun. The trial itself is very boring and the end of the true crime podcast is very weird. Could have stoped after 2.5 hours.What makes you watch the 2.5 hours is the very unique set and acting that really gets you into that era .The crimes are a bit mess and happens without a very coherent narrative besides the overall explanation of the motives.The FBI part was not very clear. How they ended up taking over and how the investigation concluded.The trial is very boring and adds no new information or reveals.The end instead of captions that summarise some facts, was a true crime show on stage which was very weird.",positive
617,A movie with big characters and very nice script based on real story only scorcece for me can project it correctly. Most of the people disagree with the duration of the movie it was three hours movie but for me felt like two hours because it has a very nice character input and evolution. During the time also the anonymity of the crimes it was that who made it more excising. Of course all this it will be nothing without Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De niro that duo it fits perfectly.The story is about a tribe of Native Americans who discovered oil in Osage at the start of 20th century. Our protagonist Earnest (DiCaprio) and his uncle (De Niro) are on a mission to snatch that money for themselves.From the beginning of the film you notice it's crime drama film and not any action movie and i think this is one of the reason who made most of the people hate this film because he tries to connect you with characters and make care for them.Also every fan of Scorsese knows how it works on his films and I think this is one of his best films made.It's a crime for me to say it's a bad film made by this people.,positive
618,"You know that feeling when a filmmaker has been banging out classics for decades, hitting a real high stride over the past decade, and then his next movie is pretty good? Yeah...it's kind of deflating. Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, based on the book by David Grann, is an earnest look at a hundred year old series of crimes that thematically feels right at home in his body of work, and yet it makes a miscalculation around its point of view character that really seems to hamper the whole thing, taking the extremely precise skill and execution of late-stage Scorsese and muddling things just enough to take it from what could have been great to something merely good. Remind you, it's still quite good (it ends really well), but, well, its central character is a moron.The Osage Nation, which has been forcibly moved from Missouri to Arkansas to Kansas and finally to a reservation in Oklahoma have discovered that the land the federal government has given them is rich with oil, making them the richest people per capita on the planet. This has brought the wolves to their doorstep as they enjoy their riches but also begin dying in mysterious ways. Into this world comes Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), a WWI vet to live with his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro), a cattle rancher and friend of the Osage who immediately starts scheming on how to use his nephew to get as much of the Osage money as he can. First is to get Ernest and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone) together. They quickly develop an affinity for each other and marry, giving Hale his in into the Osage property through her family, but she's one of four daughters to a living mother.Now, my central issue with this film is really Ernest and his innate dumbness. He's a dumb character, and it undermines what seems to be the intended purpose of him actually being in an internal conflict about the terrible things he's helping along at the behest of his uncle and his genuine love for Mollie. Despite DiCaprio's committed performance and Scorsese's precise direction, the writing and editing are so stacked against his intelligence that when he looks up at the terrible things he's doing into his wife's eyes, all I see is a complete lack of connection, like he has literally no idea that he's hurting her.And hurt her he does. It's all behind her back and behind closed doors (reminding me of William Wyler's final film, The Liberation of L. B. Jones), but Ernest has a direct hand in the bombing of her sister Rita (JaNae Collins) and husband Bill (Jason Isbell) by arranging it with Acie Kirby (Pete Yorn). He is always around Hale while he works with Ernest's older brother Byron (Scott Shepherd) who executes Anna (Cara Jade Myers), Mollie's older sister. And that points to another reason I feel like Ernest shouldn't have been the main character: he's only part of the larger conspiracy and violence. A lot of it happens away from him, and yet he's carrying the guilt for all of it, reminding me slightly of the amorphous judgment in The Wolf of Wall Street. He's a small cog, but he does have what might be the most potent connection to the Osage out of all of them, so it still makes sense that he would be the focus.The point where Ernest's idiocy kind of reaches the worst point is when Mollie, sickly because she suffers from diabetes but given insulin through the intercession of Hale, becomes deeply suspicious of everyone around her except Ernest to the point where she demands that Ernest be the only one who administer her daily shot, cutting out the doctors. The doctors, though, tell Ernest to add a small vial to every bottle of insulin, all while Mollie only gets worse with the administration of the supposed miracle cure to her affliction. It's obvious that he makes some kind of connection, being torn between orders indirectly from his uncle and the suffering of his wife, but I see it performed and written more like he simply doesn't understand. He thinks that maybe there's something wrong with the instructions but he simply can't make the connection because it isn't explain to him directly.The latter half of the film is centered around the arrival of the federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons), out to investigate the murders and quickly discovering the insular world he's stepped into while using a set of undercover agents to help him gather intelligence. The noose around Ernest quickly tightens because, again, he's not terribly bright and the crimes are so heinously blatant, and the conflict within Ernest really seems to finally be understood by him. It's being confronted with consequences that makes him finally realize what's going on, finally getting him to question the vial he's putting into his wife's medicine.Now, I should mention Brendan Fraser. He's got a very small part near the end, and the sudden explosion of noise around his performance online that came up when the film was released wide made me expect something quite different from what I got. I was expecting a show-stopping performance so out of line with everything around it that it just ended good feeling for the film, but he's honestly barely in it. He has one concentrated dose of dialogue where he explains to Ernest to not testify against his uncle, and it's overbearing but far from some kind of Southern caricature on the lines of Foghorn Leghorn.Anyway, Mollie really is the heart of the film, and it's unfortunate because she's really passive in the face of everything that happens (most likely in alignment with the real Mollie) and gets sidelined for long stretches because of her illness. It's not Ernest's moral quandary of killing his wife or following his uncle's orders that's the emotional core, it's Mollie realizing that her husband is a monster. The moment she realizes the depths of his evil is a quiet one at the very end. It's far from histrionic, just giving Mollie this still moment to observe her husband and ask him a single question.I do also like how Scorsese ends the film with the recap of everything that happens afterwards with a recreation of a radio production rather than just scrawling text. It gives him a nice little cameo at the end, too (I think he had a voice cameo as a photographer earlier, as well).So, it's a wildly impressive physical production, impeccably made by Scorsese with serious Apple money. It's performed really well. DiCaprio gives this dumb character his all, almost making him feel more multidimensional than he probably deserves, while De Niro so easily balances on this evil line between charismatic and scheming. It's Gladstone's performance that has the most effect, though, and she's very good.I just feel like the focus on Ernest, a stupid character who really just doesn't seem to understand what he's doing, was a mistake that hobbles the film more than it deserves. This is a serious film with strong entertainment in its crime genre, doing everything it can to elevate the genre in the process, but the moral quandary at the center is just not something I'm terribly convinced by.It's good, though. That's for sure.",positive
619,"It's maybe a bit too long, but this is a movie which you can just watch, admire and think okay this is what movie lovers would make. It's not your usual action packed movie, or your happy ending movie, it's just like the Alfred Hitchook said ""real life without boring parts"". Not a single shot or dialogue here feels useless. I wouldn't take anything away. It can be a bit long to sit for 4 hours in cinema but it's just truly amaizing. Performances are just woow, I have a feeling like De Niro and DiCaprio are not real humans, they just make them for different movies. They are like robotos, they do it all. Definitely go see this masterpiece.",positive
620,"No argument here that Martin Scorsese is a master filmmaker. Though, I tend to find his films unnecessarily long, and on occasion, on the verge of being uninteresting. Such is the case with 'Killers of the Flower Moon'.It's an important story, yes. But it's a story that could have easily been done in a 2.5 hour film, not 3.5 hours. That's the honest truth, and will probably be everyone's main criticism. I went out of the theatre for five to ten minutes two thirds through and literally felt like I missed nothing. I enjoy long movies, but if a movie is 3.5 hours, it better be worth it, and this one just ain't.The ending was very neat and creative. Much better than the standard text paragraphs you read most times.",positive
621,"Wow. What a hard, hard watch. Although it felt like 7 hours long, every minute was painstakingly thought out to unravel such a horrifying and disgusting murder mystery of the Osage nation (this entire story actually happened). It's beautifully shot, great writing and acting all around, but such a tough watch for facing a dark story in our country's history. I'm so glad Apple broke into the TV/movie business because their stuff keeps getting better. This is an artisanal film, full of depth and a heavy subject matter, and well worth the 3.5hr runtime (if you can sit there that long) about a story that desperately needs to be told.",positive
622,"Finally sat down for the full 3.5 hours of this latest Scorsese crime epic. Certainly, it's extraordinary (!!!) filmmaking in a number of senses, and we're lucky that extravagant projects like this still occasionally get made. The time flew by. The world it evokes is tangible and exquisitely drawn.And yet, and yet.Essentially, this is a huge film entirely focused on these grubby greedy killers who do not learn, grow, or change. The only one who comes close to having a moral arc is DiCaprio's character, Ernest. We're teased along for roughly 3 hours and 10 minutes (rather expertly) by the suggestion that his moral crisis is going to crest. But does it? Yes, he testifies against his uncle in the end, when every other path forward looks hopeless. We don't actually learn if his testimony makes the crucial difference or not. We do learn that he's still unable to admit the truth of what he was doing to his wife Mollie.Ernest is sculpted as a morally weak and confused person from the start, and he remains that. Overall, rather than being a 100% moral failure, he's a 96% moral failure thanks to that 11th hour testimony.Mollie, on the other hand, is fascinating. Her choices, her strengths, her weaknesses, are all compelling and narratively rich. Yet we're very rarely in her point of view--and almost never in the POV of any other Native Americans. We see them taking decisive actions, here and there, but mostly they are the objects of action, done to more than doing.This is a story about a crime network--the standard, delectable, high-calorie Scorsese fare--but unlike Goodfellas or The Departed, I struggle to find it compelling from the inside. It's not the source material--Oklahoma racist murderers who pass themselves off as friends of Native Americans is INCREDIBLE source material--as it is, I think, a limit of the writers to probe that source material boldly. Scorsese has shown that he can seduce you into identifying with fiends. Here he just mostly shows you fiends.",positive
623,"I didn't know anything about the film, watched it on the strength of the names involved in it. I won't make that mistake again.I found it utterly boring, I struggled to stay awake at times. There was nothing really going on. So many scenes went nowhere. The way the story was told wasn't very engaging. It's like they wanted to include so stuff to make it factually correct and lost track of making an engaging film.If this was a 3 part series on Netflix I wouldn't have got past the first part. I was tempted to leave the cinema.The acting was decent but the story and the way it was told left me questioning how this got made.",positive
624,"Scorsese nails it once again in this sweeping epic which details the deception and greed surrounding the discovery of oil on Osage lands in 1920's America.The story is a remarkable one that is gripping from start to finish. It has a lot of the Scorsese trademarks such as nefarious rogues and mobsters, a very matter of fact portrayal of violence, the pursuit by law enforcement. But it is the emotional richness and depth of this film that stands out, perhaps being the finest of Scorsese's career.Regarding the story, some may recoil at the runtime, but it never feels excessive. I can't think what could have been cut from this film, as every scene has something to say and contributes to the richness of the story.As with any Scorsese film the cast is always incredible. Dicaprio and De Niro team up to create some really great performances, and Lily Gladstone steals the show with an utterly absorbing performance.What also shines about this film is the attention to detail. All of the costumes and set designs and finer touches are spot on and only add to the rich and engaging setting, which is so easy to get lost in.All of this comes together to create a truly epic feeling film that will keep you hooked for its entirety. A truly brilliant film.",positive
625,"Scorsese another masterpiece with Deniro, but as always, Leo steals the movie. Leo puts another notch on his belt and proves once again why he's the best. Oscar nominee coming. But his Indian counterpart was no slouch either. These two were a dynamic duo... throw in Deniro and you have a hit. Some will say it is too long and yes it does have some drawn out moments but it hardly feels like 3.5 hours. The score also doesn't disappoint. Scorcese nailed it from scene to scene. Really the only issue I had with it was the ending which seemed a little rushed especially when it goes offscreen. The movie is an 8/10 but the book is a 10/10. Before you see this, the book is a MUST.",positive
626,"I expected a criminal (as categorized by the producer). However I found myself watching a 3.5-hour ethnographical documentary.The investigation of the crime, which I expected to possess the larger part of this film, took up only 1/4 of the content, and based only on witness statements - I understand that at that time there was no advanced technology as today in the crime lab, but I hoped something more.The first 3/4 part was really long-drawn-out. The bright side is, however, that the film depicit in detail the culture of the Osage, that why for me it qualifies an ethnography. In all, I'm stunned by the crimes commited by the White to the Indians.",positive
627,"I haven't feel so Angry in last few year watching a movie... Such kind of murders and most people know nothing about them.More Angry, because so many viewers of this movie think that it's length was to much! Probably they think 2 hours maximum would be ok, so they can have an amusement on their free time....
All of them have families with children, have friends, have peope they probably say they care about.., maube because they were Indians it is not that important..
The movie was long enough, so you can comprehend the magnitude of the killers actions and a part of the victims feelings.Maybe not too long!!!",positive
628,"Killers Of The Flower MoonOverall it was good not great and certainly not as good as the hype surrounding this movie.What was great, styling and cinematography, great direction and brilliant music.What was good, we had good script delivered by committed actors exploring a worthy subject, that's it!What was seriously problematic, a near glacial pace for no particular reason than perhaps to infer we were watching something profound. A great deal of repetition, similar murders, sitting in cars, conversations, facial expressions, medical procedures, actors being tired. To my mind a decent edit would have greatly improved this movie.Overall I was bored and the whole movie was tedious, Robert de Niro played himself, Leonardo DiCaprio seem to be ripping off Marlon Brando, and seem to employ two faces throughout. Lily Gladstone, who played Molly did a fabulous job, but we had little range from her apart from exhausted and placid and the odd emotional outburst.With regard to the Oscars I Think at best, it would go to the adapted screenplay or indeed the music or cinematography, but there is just not a single stand out acting part that deserves a gong.Overall, I'm giving this a 6 out of 10. I'm glad I watched it, but I never want to think about this movie ever again. Hollywood should stick to entertainment and not trot out worthy garbage in an attempt to educate us!",positive
629,"This is a great movie, and only Scorsese could bring in the audience it deserves in this day and age. Its sad to say, but we are in a repeating phase of history where white people are disinterested in the atrocities committed by their forefathers. In yester years these sorts of movies might have had more of an audience at the box office. We have right wing parties rising, anti-immigration agendas, and arrogance is rising at an unprecedented rate. This sort of movie has fallen out of fashion, and would usually be lucky to get a tv miniseries budget today. So I must appraise all those involved, and Martin Scorsese is showing no signs of wilting with age, knocking out this epic 3.5 hr movie. It is a master class in human depravity, and if you were born with a conscience, you will spend most of the movie in disgust at their callous acts. Its hard to imagine a movie with more reprehensible characters, and unfortunately this is a true story about the despicable things white people were doing to American Indians back in the 1920's to take their oil money. It is a very good character study, and an important movie others can learn from.",positive
630,"Of course this tremendous drama, historical drama evoking the roots of America can be easily compared with Michael Cimino's HEAVEN'S GATE, another huge, mammoth production telling a story about which United States of America could not be proud of. HEAVEN'S GATE was about settlers genocide by the land owners, authorized by the government; and this story, terrific but awful story explains how American White moguls behaved with the Natives in Oklahoma who had found oil on their lands...This masterpiece is not told to the praise and glory of America. It is painful to watch, and enhanced by the jaw dropping performance of this actress playing Molly's character. Leonardo Di Caprio is here the contrary of a hero; he is weak, clumsy, contemptible, disgusting, nasty. The way he behaves with his poor wife, who TRUSTED him. Oh my God, I have rarely been so disgusted by a character in a drama. I guess that, in the forties or fifties, such a character would have perfectly fit to George Sanders or Zach Scott Yes, this is a real exceptional film.",positive
631,"Quantity does not equal quality. Great story well told, could have used more action if it was going 3.5 hours. Acting good especially DiCaprio & Gladstone. De Niro was good, playing himself, grumpy old man. Plemons great as usual, I called that back in Breaking Bad. Please Brendan Frazier, lose 100 lbs. The plot was easy to follow, did not need a lot of build up, so the movie was boring and dragged in the middld, I snoozed a few minutes in the theatre. I'd rank it behind other Scorsese greats, Departed, Goodfellows, Wolf. I do believe if Scorsese employed more humor in his movies, he would have earned many more Oscars, many more. Humor breaks the drama without ruining the plot. I laughed only once when DeNiro was paddling DiCaprio. Not believable, who would let another man spank him, but I could see DeNiro really getting his kicks out of whalloping his protege.",positive
632,"Killers of the flowermoon
When you realize that there is a movie that is directed by someone like Martin Scorsese and the whole history that you have about his filmography you wonder what the next will be?Will be better and how can he solve this?Martin Scorsese really used the appropriate tools starting from a good scenario choosing the right place to visualize his papers and a hugely talented crew. Imagine that a film has Leonardo dicapreo and Robert de Nero without neglecting of course the performance of Lily Gladstone when you have a movie that its duration is 3 hours and 38 minutes and you don't feel bored it's for sure that it was made by a tremendous effort great job from anyone who participated in this.",positive
633,"I was so hyped to see this movie even before the trailers expecting to see a masterpiece but in the end it fells flat that makes me unsatisfied.The story started very well with so much potential going but in the end nothing unexpected happens. The performances of De Niro and Goldstone was very good but sorry not an oscar winning performances with the all the competition this year especially for ""the king"".For Dicaprio and Scorsese; this wasn't convincing at all especially Leo who is one of the best actors for me. This is nearly the first time where Dicaprio doesn't impress me with his performance and for Mr. Scorsese I wished for a masterpiece but maybe the writing was the problem.I would normally give this movie a 6 but I will give it a 7 as it shows that Americans are greedy and sees murdering of innocents is normal as long as it benefits them.Wake up world and see who is the true victim of these crimes.",positive
634,"Last night I saw Martin Scorsese's new film Killers of the Flower Moon in the movie theater, which is based on true events surrounding the 1920s murders of many members of the Osage Indian tribe in Oklahoma, and is adapted from a book by David Grann, which I read prior to seeing the film.The film is not a cinematic masterpiece like I've heard so many reviewers saying. The massive 3 hour and 30 minute runtime I feel was unnecessary, and the story could've been trimmed down by an hour. There are certain movies that are 3 hours long that do a fantastic job at capturing your attention right from the get go and not letting go, and that are executed well in their story (films like Oppenheimer, The Batman, and Lord of the Rings: Return of the King do this kind of thing perfectly) but Killers of the Flower Moon slogs on in some places and the pacing drags on, to where you're sitting there either falling asleep or wondering when the movie will get to the point it's trying to make. The pacing and the runtime fail in their execution for me.Money is the root of all evil, and that's no exception here in the story. Even though I read the book beforehand, (the book is an absolute page-turner) audiences, even if they haven't read the book are given the information of who is being the murders and who is trying to steal the Osage's massive amount of wealth. It's blantantly obvious and I wish there would've been a better story along the lines of a proper whodunnit. This just seemed like a poorly executed who-didn't-do-it. It gets very confusing at certain points and even I got confused and I had read the book beforehand. And because of that the movie drags on and on and on and doesn't hold your attention the whole time.However, that being said, it IS filled with Oscar worthy performances by Leonardo DeCaprio and Lily Gladstone. Their presence and performances alone are what kept me from almost walking out of the theater. So nuanced and so deeply layered performances, they are the only two bright parts in the whole mess. Robert DeNiro's performance however, is so blatantly obvious, stale, and so generic; it almost seems like he's just a cardboard cutout in the movie for a check.The movie overall certainly wasn't the greatest thing in the world, but it certainly wasn't the worst. I've had better times at the movies this year, especially in a 3 hour movie (Oppenheimer still holds the top spot as the best movie I've seen this year) but even if you enjoy westerns as much as I do, you'd probably be wise to steer clear of this one in general. Besides, it's probably a movie that I would not give a second viewing to.",positive
635,"Watched it yesterday. Scorcese is still giving us the cinema we all need. The long scenes with light yet little intense conversations. De caprio and Lilly gladstone and ofcourse Sir De niro, all make this movie a must watch. Read about the movie that most of the dresses were made by indian community only and the languages etc. Were also properly taught by them to the crew. Thats great. I just hope some current directors also go on to become great like Scorcese and peoduce such work which is based on reality.Felt sad for the indian community. And hence it should be seen more and more by everyone so that the reality of the horrors faced by a community in United states of america can be understood.",positive
636,"Di Caprio and De Niro play their roles perfectly, I enjoyed this movie and had no problem with its lenght but that Is just me. I could have watched it for 4 hours. But I was not satisfied with that ending, I wont spoil anything but I think the ending could have been much better. I would give that ending prologue 2/10 but the rest of the movie is 10/10 for me. Only other thing that bothered mi is the age of Di Caprio and De Niro. They are little bit older for this roles. But they are the best ever for sure so I am still happy that they did this, I dont think anyone else could do this. They are truly the greates ever in my book.",positive
637,"I can honestly say that outside of a few moments, I was never swept away by or immersed deeply within the story as I typically am by most great movies. Instead, throughout its entire 3 1/2 hour runtime, I was very conscious that I was watching a movie. The film keeps you at arms length as though forcing the viewer to constantly grapple with the story on an intellectual instead of emotional level. It honestly feels more documentary than fictionalisation.As a result of all this, you'd expect the length to be an issue but it just wasn't for me. Not sure if that was due to the acting which was fantastic. The dialogue which was great. Or just simply the deeply harrowing but engaging source material.Truly a disturbing tale but one that needed telling and it's handled with such care by everyone involved. Fantastic film.",positive
638,"Martin Scorsese's harrowing 1920s true-crime epic motion picture about love, betrayal, murder, and monstrous greed. It concerns the horrific Oklahoma killing spree that was perpetrated by white Americans against the oil-rich families of the Osage Indian Nation who were the wealthiest people in the United States at that time. These atrocious murders were committed by husbands, lovers, friends, and federally appointed guardians who were after their vast fortune. Leonardo DiCaprio magnificently plays Ernest Burkhart, a U. S. Army soldier who returns from World War I to live with his manipulative money-hungry rancher uncle William 'King' Hale, brilliantly played by Robert De Niro in a scene-stealing performance, who is a nefarious schemer that secretly takes advance of the Osage at every turn, and is man behind many of the murders that are never investigated by the corrupt local lawmen. Hale encourages Ernest to seek and marry an Osage woman so he can keep her big money in the family, and he soon meets a pure-blood Osage Indian woman named Mollie Burkhart, wonderfully played by Lily Gladstone in an impressive performance, she is truly heartbreaking and is the emotional center of this film, they fall in love and have three children as the murders continue all around them, until finally the FBI is sent to investigate these killings and the suspicious circumstances behind them. Astute direction by Scorsese, and stellar cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, and an evocative score by the late Robbie Robertson. At three hours and twenty six minutes this is a very long film that is a slow burn, but it is an artistic and rewarding cinematic masterpiece.",positive
639,This is so long yet there is very little substance to it. Some Indians were killed in some plot to secure their oil by some bad white people. Boo hoo. There is very little emotion in the film. Everyone dies all the time. There is no action or suspense. You will need energy drinks so as you don't fall asleep. There are too many characters with little to nothing to add to the story. Yet it doesn't drag. Sure it's the longest thing you'll ever see but it's watchable at the same time. It just seems to keep on going and then it ends very abruptly. So I don't think it's well paced to take 3.5 hours getting there to have such a poor ending. There is no payoff for watching this self indulgent movie for so long. At least when Tarantino makes a long film there is always a payoff for having watched. It's a good experience that you walk away going yeah that was good. It was long but good. This is beyond long and there is no payoff.,positive
640,"After seeing the first trailer for this film I knew I had to watch it and I'm definitely glad I did. This is the first Martin Scorsese movie I have ever watched so I didn't know what to expect and boy did I not expect this. For a 3 hour and 26 minute movie I thought my attention span would be low but from the second it starts there is not a scene wasted. The performances are Oscar worthy Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always, Robert De Niro is great but Lily Gladstone is the real star the emotion she brings to her character I can't think of any other role this year that could top her performance.",positive
641,"Wanted to watch this since its premiere in Cannes. Especially because Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favourite actors.Its a very well put together film and very well directed. Cinematography and filming is very good.Acting is extremely good by every actor in the film. Outstanding performances!Its a great film to show how important it is to pick sides and that choices have consequences.Also well written. Soundtrack is pretty good.But i need to be honest and say that it's definitely too long and abit too slow. Too much time, without anything actually happening. It would been a better film if shortened with a hour or so.Truly a very important film to watch that makes you think.However its slightly confusing sometimes.I can really recommend it. A very well made film that you definitely should give a try and really worth watching, despite it being so long.",positive
642,"I had high expectations for this film, at first me and partner thought it was a slow burner, but in reality it never got started. It was truly boring, I don't understand why it's been called a masterpiece and DiCaprio's best role yet when most of the film he's pulling an upside down face. Very bland acting and one of those films that are forgotten once out of the box office.Would not recommend spending money to watch this as during the film those in the audience were signing and a couple two rows in front fell asleep as we could hear them snoring at one point. As far as the ending of the film which you'll be 3.5 hours in at that point, was just as anti climactic as the rest of the film.",positive
643,"Killers of the Flower Moon, Martin Scorsese's historical crime drama, is riveting and challenging cinema that deeply confronts American cultural trauma in 1920s Oklahoma, featuring three awards-worthy performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and newcomer Lily Gladstone.Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese's screenplay does a wickedly brilliant switcheroo, telling the story from the villains' perspective, framing them as protagonists and the Native American victims as the antagonists.Scorsese has used this trope before. The gangsters from Goodfellas and Casino are anti-heroes who are funny and charming to be around, in movie terms. In Flower Moon, the characters are downright despicable irredeemable villains and it delivers a completely different experience.Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro's on-screen personas, which we recognize as heroic and likable faces, are completely subverted 180Â° degrees. As the story takes their perspective, the audience subconsciously becomes complicit with their villainy.Leonardo DiCaprio fits his portrayal of Ernest Burkhart in sync with Scorsese's role reversal approach-perhaps the most precise he's ever tuned his performance to a film's aesthetic. DiCaprio deep dives into the morally grey, morphing his face into a perpetual grimace like a Greek tragedy mask and becoming gradually murkier and murkier like a vat of white paint and black paint being slowly stirred for 3 hours.I didn't know how to feel about the Ernest character the entire time. Does he love his wife and children? Or is he doing it just for the money? What does he want? Does he even know what he wants? Is he just foolish?I kept guessing and flip-flopping until the end, and the question remained unanswered. The character frustrated me in a way that I've never been frustrated before from a film, which was quite the achievement.Robert De Niro delivers his best performance since The Irishman in his most wicked character yet (and he's played the Devil), cleaning the slate of all his comedy grandpa roles of late. The William Hale character is abhorrently nonchalant about his evil towards the Native Americans, viscerally giving the depths of what people can do when they don't regard others as human. It's chilling to watch.Lily Gladstone delivers an understated performance, acting completely with her eyes and body as the audience avatar, letting the story context work by itself and letting the audience's sympathies pour into her character.The musical score by the late Robbie Robertson is eclectic and minimal, incorporating Native American music, blues and electric guitar. It is all scored suggestively. The Heartbeat theme is a pulsing suspicion-rousing Native drum beat has one looking over their shoulders and Robbie Robertson's solo vocal Still Standing was moving and heartfelt.I loved this film. It's a near masterpiece and I don't use that word lightly.The 3-hour 26-minute runtime, the film's most common criticism, was worth it. Could this have been a shorter film? Absolutely. If one needs to use the restroom, judge the right moment and just go.In Scorsese's capable hands, I was fully engaged and was transported into a historical period and was shocked, moved and even laughed out loud at a few darkly comedic moments. The ending was especially brilliant, like a concert conductor whipping his baton to a dramatic finish and artfully launching the audience into contemplating the story immediately.",positive
644,"If one were inclined toward cynicism one might wryly observe that white filmmakers are so desperate to avoid centering First Nation people, or at least so accustomed to pushing them to the margins, that they would rather center the despicable, powerful white men who participated in horrific violence and conspiracies, and devote the preponderance of the writing to those characters, than to portray indigenous people as having any especial agency, or indeed to flesh out their characters even when working with historical subject matter. If one were inclined toward cynicism one might wryly observe that it's not until we're more than halfway through a runtime of a little over 200 minutes that the narrative seems to open up so as to turn its attention away - to some degree - from those villainous figures, and as it does, the narrative instead turns its eyes to white investigators, questioning white conspirators, thusly pushing the Osage even further to the edges of the picture as the ice grows thin under the antagonists' feet. If one were inclined toward cynicism one might wryly observe that Lily Gladstone, remarked to be the first indigenous American actress nominated for an Academy Award, unquestionably fully deserves any such accolades, yet while she is and should be nominated for Best Actress, the fact is that her role is sufficiently small as this feature is written that by all reason the nominations should be for Best Supporting Actress, a category that perpetually feels like the proverbial second fiddle eclipsed by the foremost stars.Don't misunderstand: I think 'Killers of the flower moon' is, overall, a great film. I don't think anyone could ever say Martin Scorsese's direction is less than impeccable in orchestrating shots and scenes; it's beautifully shot, and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto is to be congratulated. The production values are top-notch all around, including pristine sound and image quality, fantastfic costume design, hair, and makeup, sharp stunts and effects, terrific sets and filming locations, and even splendid consideration for lighting. Fine music adds flavoring on the edges. Cynicism is a reasonable reaction, but it remains true that Scorsese is to be commended to striving to be more thoughtful and inclusive of Osage people, involving them as actors and in the production otherwise, and making fairly substantial use of the Osage language throughout the movie. The casting is superb, and all involved give grand, commanding performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro give marvelous performances as Ernest and William, very ably capturing the underhanded complexity of these men's emotions and nefarious activities with duplicitous, cold visages (even if it seems like they're chewing scenery every now and again). Gladstone's performance is exquisitely nuanced and understated, defined by tremendous, subtle range and poise, and if I'm being completely honest I'm upset that her part is so small by comparison - even as the screenplay is imbalanced and favors DiCaprio and De Niro by leaps and bounds, strictly speaking I believe her soft, reserved acting plainly outshines the icons and more recognizable names and faces.All this is to say nothing of the horrid truths brought out in this title of the awful living history of the United States. We're confronted with ugly racism, whether overt, casual, or backhanded, and both personal and institutional; far-reaching corruption and collusion; the infantilization, marginalization, and dehumanization of indigenous and other non-white peoples, not to mention genocide; and among much more, glimpses of how violence and death are grotesquely treated as sensational spectacles appropriate for gossip, showboating, and photo ops instead of as the tragedies and crimes that they are. We can and should scrutinize the details of this titanic flick, but it does remain true that Eric Roth, adapting David Grann's account of terrible real-life events, has woven a deeply absorbing, compelling story, with complicated characters and striking, meticulous scene writing. We do indeed see the breadth and depth of the crimes committed against the Osage, see the extent and cruelty of those who operated against them, and get perspective on the lives of all those figures involved. It's also true that for as dark and engrossing as the picture is, it is surely longer than it needed to be - and above all, I believe it's true that in a runtime of just over 200 minutes, it is specifically, emphatically, the last twenty minutes that hit all the right notes, and cut deeply, and achieve a profundity of storytelling and beauty of cinema that truly makes this worthy of all the praise, awards, and nominations it has garnered. 'Killers of the flower moon' isn't the first celebrated feature that I would describe in such terms; most notably, Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain,' in 2005, and Celine Song's 2023 directorial debut 'Past lives,' both roundly excellent as this is, can also be said to boast their most significant, worthy, enduring strength in the last several minutes. It is interesting, though, that 'Killers' is so very long to have its last ten percent stand out most.I think this is a very, very good movie. I don't necessarily think it's everything it could have been, because its length inherently spreads it thin a little, because the actor with the best performance and a pivotal role is nevertheless somewhat sidelined, and because of how the antagonists are put front and center when it would have been very feasible to bring the Osage to the foreground without impacting the tenor of the whole. Everyone who had a hand in its creation is to be congratulated for all their hard work, and for the end result; I'm glad for those who find it to be even more satisfying and rewarding than I do. Ultimately the value that is represented here outweighs the criticisms one may level, and I give the film my glad, solid recommendation. I just think that 'Killers of the flower moon' isn't the purely stellar slice of modern cinema that it is made out to be, and if one enters with tempered expectations, perhaps that will help one to appreciate it more when all is said and done.",positive
645,"I have a massive problem with this film, I understand the project was reformulated from a police-procedural into a story centred around a romantic relationship and I think I understand what Scorsese was doing and how powerful this could have been, he has experience in telling these kind of stories and there are some impressive moments of genius but I just don't believe the central romance, to me it feels improperly demonstrated and surreal, which makes the whole thing surreal. As the story looses plausibility the focus shifts back to the investigation, and is elevated significantly by the good work of Jesse Plemons but this remains only a third act in what is clearly an incredibly over-long edit and it's not enough to hold it together. Add in some questionable-quality CGI for an estimated $200 million production, and some inexcusably bad ADR, and a piece of set design/lighting that looked like it was out of a small-theatre low-budget play...I can see a lot of the budget was spent on the big period outdoor sets and props and costume, although a lot of this looked far too new and shiny and was in need of dressing down. And the no-doubt meticulously researched Native American cultural detail seemed both well-placed and justified but it is unfortunately mostly wasted if the story doesn't work.I think this is why a lot of people find this film unpleasant, they are experiencing being stretched between a romance you're told pulls two people together and seeing something that doesn't make any/much sense on a human level, all surrounded by shiny realism and an emotive soundtrack, and that's uncomfortable. I'm not disputing the facts of historical record this story is based on, but there was clearly more going on, more coercion probably, or just downright unapologetic entitled exploitation...maybe that is why the film ends the way it does, almost as an apology. It seems this was yet another troubled Apple-financed (possibly over-financed) production, tinkered with to leverage their platform, it also seems the US is even now still struggling to be objective about its trouble-filled past. This film takes itself so seriously and yet Avatar (in the broadest sense) tells this story better!",positive
646,"I understand this is based on a true story, but this film needed a lot of tightening up. First the good stuff. Representing the early 20s was flawlessly done from sets to costumes to hairstyles. The acting is well done, as you might expect. Now for the stuff that detracted from the film. Why were people still wearing WWI uniforms in the 20s when the war had been over for 2 years? They obviously didn't just get back from the war. It wasn't clear why they kept killing all the Native Americans, jealousy? They made sure to emphasize that the tribe members were getting rich from the oil on their land, and robbing them would make basic sense, but why kill them? And the plot that they would murder 4 members of a family while being married to the last surviving member to get their money is tenuous at best. One second DeNiro is killing people, the next he is super religious, and back and forth, makes no sense.While I appreciate them making all the effort to stage a full blown live band and actors fake radio drama to provide an epilogue for the resulting jail sentences etc. But it seems really forced and the movie is already WAY too long to drag it out, just give us a few text screens to read.. It was also kind of strange to see Jack White in that radio show scene. So technically a very well done movie, but not worth over 3 hours of my time.",positive
647,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a superbly paced and important film with excellent performances. The story delves into a rarely discussed subject matter, and I appreciated the mystery it unfolds from the beginning. Going in blind without prior knowledge of the plot was a rewarding experience. The film masterfully portrays everyday conversations about money and schemes with an ominous undertone. As the story unfolds, the true nature of events becomes increasingly evident. The performances, including De Niro and DiCaprio, are top-notch, with Lily Gladstone standing out as a personal favorite. It's an impressive movie, and Martin Scorsese's continued excellence at 80 is truly remarkable.",positive
648,"We don't get many movies like Killers of the Flower Moon nowadays, and there's only one reminding us that important stories matter: Martin Scorsese. This is sort of a culmination of all his works coming together with his best working pals De Niro and DiCaprio. The heavy subject matter truly shows the colors of greed and how men are capable of making inhuman choices in order to get what they want. DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone are amazing together, sharing a charisma that makes them the best couple on screen this year. Every scene matters; therefore, the almost four-hour runtime feels like the right pace to unfold all the cards in the story. It is beautifully shot, with high-level set design.You can feel just how much Scorsese cared about this story, delving into the deep roots of the Osage people. There's an emotional attachment to its core, with subtle traits of Scorsese showing profound respect and deep sincerity to the Osage nation. There's almost nothing negative to say about the film, but it does reach a certain point where you wish a couple of things would unfold a bit faster in the story. This film definitely ranks up with some of the best works by Scorsese, and it is certainly one of the best movies this year. Does it have a lot of rewatchability? If you want to feel miserable all the time, then yes.",positive
649,"If you are one of the people who are just thinking that they are going to watch a NEXT LEVEL OVER THE TOP Martin Scorsese's masterpiece then my friend you are going to be disappointed. It's not a masterpiece,it's not even close to a masterpiece.the movie focuses on unusual demise in Osage County and one of the family who becomes a victim is the Burkhart family , because they are rich oil people . The deaths of sisters and mother one by one make a thrill and suspense in film , but Thr film is PREDICTABLE the ending is good but the movie is like easy to write no offense to Martin Scorsese. Movie is watchable and great too but not like Goodfellas or Casino
In the End I give it a 8.3/10 and I am being Generous.",positive
650,"This was an important and powerful story that should be made a blockbuster and should be seen by the general public . A reminder in history and present day that the majority always takes advantage of the majority . The acting was absolutely fantastic - Lily Gladstone was incredible . You hated ""King"" and remarkably still felt somewhat torn on Ernest even though the guy was a total scumbag .In the end though the movie was simply too long . There was too much build and too much development- it did not help you appreciate the story or the characters it simply made you annoyed that the movie had not ended yet . The first 30 min was great , the next 1.5 hours should have been 20 min and the last hour was solid and brought it home strong . 1:50- that's what you needed here . Mostly because of the length I did find it to be quite slow and boring in parts and had to watch it over 2 nights .Important story and message , well made film , fantastic cast , simply sort of boring in parts and too long for a blockbuster.",positive
651,"I liked this film much more than I thought I would, and watching it made me think fondly of a friend and fellow cinephile who passed away recently and who was a huge Martin Scorsese fan. We used to have lively discussions about whether his long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, ever really edited anything from their films, since they're always sooooo long.This latest from Scorsese, DiCaprio, and De Niro was no exception at 3.5 hours, but we divided it into two chunks and conquered it on Sunday. The first section was excellent and portrayed a complete inversion of what white people in America had come to expect as their birthright. The Osage with oil money, in their finery and jewels, with white maids and butlers, had to have driven white society nearly mad. It's no wonder they were sitting ducks, waiting for the voracious appetite of settlers and grifters to steal what hadn't already been stolen.The second part starts once the (newly formed) FBI steps in, and is more familiar (and less interesting). There were definitely some issues with structure and narrative, and it could have been an hour shorter, yet it's still an excellent Scorsese outing and an exemplar of vision, mood, and technical precision, though not brevity. Alas.",positive
652,"Though a powerful drama, with great acting and plot. It was too long for the 3:30 hours, could've been wrapped within 150 or so minutes.There was a lot of hype about it, and Leonardo and Robert De Niro combo in a movie cannot be missed in theaters, for that it earned all the credit. Leonardo does this type of acting pretty well, and he justifies the role.From killings to the investigation, I felt the same story gets told every time, and it because so boring at a point that I had to take pee breaks twice. Second time just to stretch my legs.If you have plenty of time to kill, this is the movie to watch with some good story.",positive
653,"Time and again when a critically acclaimed director's make a movie doesn't carry anything but the wight of their name on star studded cast, just like Wes Anderson, Nolan and even guy Ritchie.They get over-confident and make terrible stories with bad editing and no pacing
This movie was a definitely a miss just by looking at story potential it could have been more entertaining and gripping if it had certain twist or plot in the end.The antagonists were obvious and very stupid and their plan was even dumber.It waste of three good hours of my time and don't even recommend to watch it on stream.",positive
654,"Phenomenal performances but overly long and lacking suspense. The book is brilliant and I had very high expectations from the movie. Scorsese made a mistake, in my opinion, by changing the narration style. Choosing to state all the facts upfront was an injustice to the story because it doesn't sufficiently engage the viewer enough. Without the acting, I think this would be rather painful to watch.Sometimes great book adaptations should stay faithful to the original storytelling. Somewhat more disappointed given the high expectations otherwise I think just the performances themselves might merit an 8.7 stars only for DiCaprio, Gladstone and De Niro.",positive
655,"I think it would be higher with a tighter script. The credits start to roll at about three hours and seventeen minutes . It's not that it's not worth watching for the length but it at times feels like less would be more.DiCaprio barely gets a break as he's in nearly the entire film. He plays a character that is both dim and sinister feeling something for his wife and children but too weak and lacking the moral fortitude to resist his uncle's ( DeNiro) nefarious plans .Lily Gladstone as Mollie is the heart of the story while Cara Jade Myers as Anna is the fire,
Covering one of the most tragic and disgraceful events in our history Killers of The Flower Moon reminds us we need these things taught in schools and talked about openly or we remain ignorant. History is not always comfortable but it should be comprehensive.",positive
656,"Incredibly well acted. Not only by DiCaprio and DeNero, but also from the rest of the cast.Visually interesting. Although they greatly differ from traditional western style and opt for a more city-like cinematography. It almost made the small town feel like a busy city street.Despite its strengths, I found the story very one-note. There is one story, one theme, and it unfolds as you might expect.The series of murders were compelling.The relationship between Leo's character and Molly was the heart of the story. Particularly well done as we move from their introduction, flirtation, courtship, marriage, difficulties, and eventual separation. It felt like a journey.The third act is when the story got some real moment with the arrival of Jesse Plemons and his fellow investigators. Certainly the strongest act.",positive
657,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a compelling film, skillfully bringing to life an overlooked historical chapter from a non-fiction book. The portrayal of this significant event is both poignant and gripping, securing its spot among the top films of the year. Brilliantly filmed with excellent character selection, the movie features a standout performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, who, as usual, delivers brilliance in his role. However, the 3.5-hour runtime, though immersive, may test patience, with some scenes feeling like they could benefit from a quicker pace. Overall, it offers a great cinematic experience, delving into an important narrative.",positive
658,"Having been massively disappointed with The Irishman, I was half expecting a similar drawn out affair, but this was a much better class of movie.The costumes and styling alone are worth an Oscar; every single character - from the Osage to the FBI - looked authentic, without being over styled.The shot composition and filmography were also pretty faultless (apart from maybe the bedroom scene in the middle of the fire, which I didn't find particularly realistic) and the acting from every single character, was perfect.You generally know what to expect from Scorsese, and this time he delivers it perfectly.There are always going to be complaints about a movie which is over 3 hours long, but I thought it was just right - hell, watch it in stages if you need to.There are a lot of characters involved, and it's a bit of a task to remember some of the names of the supporting cast - and who did what - but it's such an engrossing watch.Now, where can I get my hands on one of those amazing blanket jackets.....",positive
659,"The expectation and anticipation were high. So much opportunity here... but... disappointment! What made this movie worthwhile, a 7, was the incredible acting and the history / education the story provided.With no disrespect to Scorsese... the directing / layout of the storyline missed the mark. It was choppy, with bits of both minute and extended scenes. Some scenes that seemed like they were cut and pasted from an entirely different version of the story and some that were right at the heart of what I presume was the true nature and intent of the movie. I feel bad for the indigenous people who finally had their story brought to the big screen only to take a back seat to a directors Hollywood version. The beginning, aspects of the middle, and especially the end felt disrespectful and disingenuous.",positive
660,"It's very, very, VERY long. BUT! After two hours of watching all those Indians getting murdered, it's very, very, VERY rewarding watching FBI at work. And Leonardo DiCaprio is a proper yokel. I can't believe it's Leo! I mean, the faces he makes... My god. He must be the stupidest looking criminal in film history. Ok, maybe Eli Wallach as Tuco looks more stupid. But it's such a great portrayal of the banality of evil. His wife, so graceful, with a Mona Lisa smile. How do they make such a great couple? It's really their chemistry that makes the whole story believable. Otherwise, we would probably be wondering how come those Indian women didn't assume anything. The cinematography is decent, easy on the eyes. No fish eye, no over-the-top filters that make today's films so hard to watch. I like to see what's on the screen. The film could have been an hour shorter, but then at least the ending is smart and the director spares us of another two hours watching. But I don't hold it against him the time he took. This subject deserves a film that is like one of those great American epics that they used to make in Hollywood a long time ago. I miss such films.",positive
661,"I think the director was trying to put us through the same hell he was trying to portrait to the audience. I don't want to give any spoiler alerts so I won't but I will say this, if you choose to start watching this movie, know it will be really difficult not to finish it due to its historic importance but oh my god, watching it is a slow tourture.There was everything here to make an epic film, budget, telent, an unbelievable tragedy that could have been told in a way that would shake the world but somehow, this time, MS missed, big time, from the music, till the every other little detail and maybe that was the purpose but if it was, I really didnt get it.I can't say it was a waste of time as it was indeed an important story to tell the world but it could have been done in a 120 min thrilling documentary on Netflix, and much much much more to the point and better.",positive
662,"Killers of the flower moon follows the famous novel adapted story. Ernest, the nephew of a prominent and powerful businessman in an Osage county, falls in love with a very wealthy Osage woman in the area. The tails focuses on a series of crimes happening around the city with the continuous killings of Osage Indians on the area.The Western/Crime story is told through the relationship of Ernest with Mollie.I'm not going to go further into the story as it isn't needed to describe the incredible perception of Scorsese's film and storytelling.While long, the film manages to stand out with its unique style and theme that staus throughout the duration of the movie. Leo, Lilly and De Niro stand out with their amazing perfomances as expected.Unfortunately though, the narrative carries out for too long, with a lot of people not wanting to admit that in fear they might offend Scorsese's abilities. Scorsese is a director, one of the best to ever do so, but flaws are to be expected while taking an artistic risk, he said that himself. It's necessary to take that risk and yes, sometimes it will not deliver. While this isn't the case with Killers of the Flower Moon it does have a problem with pacing at times. It stretches out to include more details and some times manages to ""dry out"" the viewer.Nevertheless the fact that he's able to continue creating amazing movies after all these years is proof of his amazing persona as a director.Killers of the flower moon might not be the perfect film but it sure is unique. The theme that it greatly touches into is somewhat overlooked in American history, but the film acts as a strong standpoint for its rememberance.",positive
663,"Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Ernest, deliveries an excellent performance here. I cheered for his success and frowned with disgust at his betrayal for his ""wife."" To his friends and family he is a complex character but to the viewer he is an open book. This made for some very enjoyable watchingWilliam Hale, played by Robert De Niro, is a great manipulator. He has a hyperfixation with getting what he wants. This includes convincing his son to get married. His goals and aspirations are nothing to be snuffed at. At times his intelligence seems to make him invincible to the lawLily Gladstone's character, Mollie, is a caring wife and mother. She is indigenous to the land but for this she pays a great priceWhen Brendan Fraser's character showed up I thought his performance was going to steal the show. He really livened things up again as the length of the movie was starting to take it's toll on me.As the title suggests it's definitely worth a watch but it didn't need to be as long as it was.",positive
664,"This film is a mess. For the first hour, the native language is not subtitled, and then it is, and then it's not. It follows realtime chronological order, and then it doesn't, and then it does again. Protracted character interactions are shown that have no import, but other obviously important character interactions are skipped. The film takes an exacting, close, day-to-day exposition, then suddenly time-jumps 2 months without a word. The point of view skips around - is it Earnest, or Hale, or Mollie, or Agent White? Scorsese can't decide. The systematic killing of the Osage, and the story of Mollie's family, and the painstaking work of David Grann, deserved more. And what in the world is DiCaprio doing with his Slingblade impersonation?",positive
665,"This movie is one that will hit you in every emotion and leave a lasting impact. The Story of Mollie Kyle - aka Mollie Burkhart Cobb, is one that every person who strives to uphold truth-telling and the many wrongdoings that have befallen the Native Tribes in the Americas - and across the world. To witness how the love of money could supersede even the most compelling of love stories enough to produce the outcome of insurmountable loss that befell Mollie as an Osage woman is just one of many stories that has been under-represented and it's refreshing to see Scorsese put so many incredible actors together to produce this masterpiece but the star of the show is without a doubt Lily Gladstone. I fully expect Lily should be Oscar-nominated for her role in this movie, but beyond that I was stunned by her enthrallingly beautiful performance.",positive
666,"Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a breathtaking cinematic achievement that not only captivates audiences with its stunning visuals and impeccable storytelling but also sheds light on a dark and often overlooked chapter in American history.Lily Gladstone emerges as an undeniable highlight with a performance that is nothing short of extraordinary. Portraying the character of Mollie Burkhart, Gladstone brings a rare combination of emotional depth, nuance, and authenticity to the screen, making her a standout in an already stellar ensemble cast.One of the most remarkable aspects of Gladstone's performance is her ability to convey a myriad of emotions with subtlety and grace. Mollie Burkhart is a person marked by tragedy and resilience, and Gladstone captures the essence of her journey with an authenticity that is both heart-wrenching and compelling. From the subtlest facial expressions to the nuanced delivery of dialogue, Gladstone brings Mollie to life in a way that resonates with audiences on a profound level.",positive
667,"Rented this at home and glad I did, would rage in a theater knowing I couldn't pause and go to the bathroom if needed. No way this history couldn't have been told in under 2 hours of not less. Acting was horrid, nonsensical musical dialog that had me lowering the volume as I would get a tooth ache when the out of tune fiddle music would pierce my eardrums. The director should never direct another film and retire. Was way overrated, overpaid actors with minimum effort roles. Feel bad for what happened to the Osage Indians and the way Hollywood treated their story. I have many negative thoughts about this experience and thought people might want to know before they get duped into believing their going to have a good time.",positive
668,"A visually stunning film with exceptional cinematography, acting, costume design, music, details, story, and twists - everything is great! However, there's something missing that usually hooks viewers, compelling them to revisit and watch their favorite scenes or the entire movie repeatedly. I'm not sure what this element is called, but its absence is felt. Moreover, this story doesn't warrant a 3-hour and 30-minute runtime; it lacks a vast timeline or an extensive cast of characters. Despite some flaws, I found 'The Irishman' more captivating due to its engaging storytelling. This element seems absent here. If this film weren't a Scorsese project, I would happily rate it an 8 because everything else is great! Yet, I yearn for Scorsese's magical storytelling, which has always made him stand out. Unfortunately, I didn't find it in this film. Additionally, the suited gangster motifs and headshots from behind are becoming clichéd. Scorsese, please create a few more movies and imbue them with your unforgettable magic!",positive
669,"Ok nice again a very well written MS film. I put it ahead of Departed and the Irishman, but behind Goodfellas and Gangs of New York. The actress that plays Molly steals the show along with another great performance from Leo. Just like every other MS movie is is too long. There is a lot of filler it seems at times. Also the investigation should have taken a bigger role in the movie since it is done by a fledgling new government department the Department of Investigation later becoming the FBI. Lastly a flaw to me is DiNero. I know he is old, but in this movie is looks and moves like Biden. I believe in real life his character is like 40 years younger. One last good note the ending with them doing a live radio show was brilliant.",positive
670,"Killers of the Flower Moon is a historical drama directed by Martin Scorsese. It is based on the book written by David Grann with the same name. The film portrays the story of the Osage Nation, an indigenous tribe that experienced immense wealth due to oil discoveries on their Oklahoma land in the 1920s. Tragically, this prosperity attracted a series of murders and conspiracies targeting them. Leonardo DiCaprio takes on the role of Ernest Burkhart, a white man who marries Molly (Lily Gladstone), an Osage woman. Unbeknownst to Molly and her family, Ernest gets caught up in a sinister plot aiming to eliminate them for their inheritance. Robert De Niro portrays William Hale, Ernest's uncle and the mastermind behind this scheme. Alongside him is Jesse Plemons as Tom White, an FBI agent who diligently investigates the case with assistance from some courageous Osage informants.Killers of the Flower Moon is ambitious, delving into a neglected and profound chapter of American history. With its vast scope and scale, it aims to capture the complexity and tragedy that unfolded. Themes of greed, racism, corruption, justice, and identity intertwine in this exploration, influencing the lives and destinies of both the Osage people and those who oppressed them. The film also sheds light on the emergence of the FBI and its pivotal role in solving the case while also examining how oil shaped both society and the environment.However, despite its potential and promise, Killers of the Flower Moon fails to deliver a satisfying and coherent narrative that does justice to its subject matter. It lacks focus, direction, and pace, resulting in a sprawling and disjointed story. It attempts to cover too much ground without delving into enough depth or providing sufficient clarity. The film frequently switches between multiple perspectives and timelines, often without clear transitions or connections. Following the characters and understanding their motivations becomes challenging for viewers who may struggle to establish emotional connections. The film's reliance on exposition and narration rather than visually depicting or dramatising events leads to a lack of tension, suspense, and emotion throughout the narrative. It seems more akin to an educational history lesson rather than an enthralling thriller or a profoundly moving drama.The film suffers from inconsistent performances and technical shortcomings, which exacerbate its flaws. Both DiCaprio and De Niro are miscast and fail to convince in their respective roles, delivering wooden and exaggerated portrayals devoid of subtlety or charm. DiCaprio's accent is particularly distracting as it wavers inconsistently, while De Niro's makeup appears poorly executed and unnatural. On the other hand, Gladstone and Plemons offer more effective and sympathetic performances in their limited screen time, although their characters lack development opportunities to truly shine. The movie is beautiful to watch, but no distinctive or memorable aesthetic or atmosphere is created for the film.There are some good things about the movie. It effectively portrays the historical and cultural background of the Osage Nation and their struggles. From what I have read elsewhere, it accurately presents relevant facts and details pertaining to the case. Scorsese's directorial prowess is on full display in a few moments with impressive scenes that capture his unique talent and vision. One such scene is the impactful opening sequence, showcasing the Osage people gracefully dancing in traditional attire amidst towering oil derricks. Equally powerful are moments like when Ernest callously shoots his brother-in-law or when Tom White intensely interrogates Hale in his grand mansion.Killers of the Flower Moon disappointed and frustrated me, falling short of its potential while failing to fulfill my expectations. The film is excessively lengthy (3 hrs and 26 minutes!), tedious, superficial, clichéd, flashy, and self-indulgent. It's like a flower that hasn't fully bloomed.",positive
671,"I'm gonna get disliked for this, but honestly if you half a brain and enjoy cinematography as i have over the years and brain hasn't been corrupted by tik tok dog attention span you'll enjoy the movie. The movie isn't for everyone it is real life brutal events that shouldn't be sugar coated. It's hard to find an actual review in this imdb everything is so black or white but some things i did take away
The cinematography, score, story telling were fantastic some of the best i've seen in awhile. The supporting cast somehow were up to par with the rest of the star studded cast. I'm sorry to the people that didn't realize this was a scorsese film(you aren't getting pov from ""good guy""even in adaptation lol), a tragedy, 3 hours, and a true story that couldn't be deviated from to check your emotional feel good boxes. The length of the movie is necessary to show how excessive the violence to a lot of these tribes were. I thought it played in to how blatantly obvious who it was, the power they had, and how it was unbeatable.My only complaint would be for those who have no idea what happened in osage murders it can be a lot thrown at you at once? Since you are being told the story then and there id maybe suggest reading up on it some to get at least an idea of where you are at.",positive
672,"One Sentence Summary: A man recently returned from WWI is employed by his affluent uncle to marry into an oil-rich family and then murder them one by one.Martin Scorsese cemented himself as a legend in the world of cinema long ago, and for good reason. He consistently makes quality films, establishes new techniques and trends, and explores subjects that are universally interesting. I would consider Killers of the Flower Moon a good movie, but not a great one. The acting was terrific, the story was compelling enough, and all the technical aspects of the film were meticulously handled, but I couldn't help but feel as if the movie meandered during certain stretches. The longer a film, the harder it is to get the pacing right, so 3+ hours sometimes presents an insurmountable challenge. I had never seen Lily Gladstone in anything prior to this, but she more than held her own on screen with some of the modern-day acting giants. Although Scorsese's work continues to be solid, a film like this may be playing it a little too safe. I hold the opinion that some of his best work has come from some of his biggest swings, such as with The Wolf of Wall Street, Cape Fear, or Gangs of New York. If he decides to make another movie, I'm hoping it's a little bit more daring than Killers of the Flower Moon.",positive
673,"Again, people seem to miss the point. This was told from the POV of Ernest, not the Osage, for a reason. It is a movie, not a non-fiction book where we get hundreds of pages of details about the situation. We had to be given exposition and insight from the POV of those perpetrating the crimes and or else we would have had a film consisting of them all wandering around wondering why this was all happening and never really seen the true evil of Hale. Remember the murders had already begun before Ernest arrived on the scene.We also did get the POV of Mollie who, as Ernest's wife, had her family most affected by Hale, as he stood to gain the most out of them.Lily Gladstone was phenomenal and should win best actress awards for her performance. Leo put on his best Bill Bob Thornton Sling Blade face and did a very good job. De Niro was De Niro, love him or hate him. The rest of the ensemble cast ranged from excellent (Plemons, Shepherd, Myers) all the way to thrown in head scratching (Lithgow wasted, and Fraser still in The Whale mode). Cinematography was fantastic, and Robbie Robertson's music was a treat as his last work (RIP).In the end this was considerably much better paced to me than the over indulgent nonsense we got in The Irishman, though it definitely could have been shorter and still effective. It took me about 5 sessions to get through The Irishman on Netflix from my couch, but Killers of the Flower Moon kept me in my theater seat the whole time.The only part that really fell short for me was the ending. The now overdone radio performance. Used here as exposition for ""what happened after"". I'd have frankly rather just seen the words printed on the screen especially if it kept Scorsese's bushy brows off the big screen lol.",positive
674,"7 / 10Naturally, each and every shot is perfect, clean and clear. The cinematography is beautiful, and the editing (in terms of shot by shot) is well constructed.The sets were realistic, and the auto-mobiles used were authentic.All these technical aspects we all assume would be brilliant from someone who has been making and producing films for over 50 years.Everyone acted admirably. Everyone was convincing and performed cleanly. However was there any ground-breaking performances? In my opinion, no, not really. Simply fine and solid performances from veteran actors.Now for the downsides that I saw and felt.The costumes, for me, were a bit too perfect. Even for some of the drunks and lower-class workers, their suits were pristine. The streets were muddy, but no ones trousers or shoes sported a muddy appearance.The world building was too stretched out. There was no tension sd the main story didn't kick in until the last hour. And in the world building and bonding hours, the writers did not give enough credence and time for the Osage people and their cultures and traditions. Here and there, there were snippets, but overall it was a story about white-culture using and abusing the Osage people. They were mostly portrayed as victims who had no strategy to fight against the injustice being brought on them. I was expecting a lot more sequences of traditional music and rituals, blending and clashing with 20th century white culture.The overall trajectory of the story I felt helped create the lack of tension. Scorsese said that this film is a who-didn't-do-it story, however at about the one hour mark the villains are told to us. So, the film wasn't about who didn't do it, because we know who did do it. In a way I understand where he is coming from, however it could have hidden the true villains for longer, and thus amplify that feeling of who didn't do it.Ridiculously long, and unjustifiably so in many areas - but beautiful and clean. Worth a watch if you like Scorsese and clean cinematography.",positive
675,"My favorite reviewer here is the ""Greeting from the darkness"" dude. I appreciate their insight.But this movie was simply boring. DiCaprio's fake scowl disappears in one scene that seems laughable- when he is trying to hire a man for a job; makeup crew skipped a day, perhaps? I cant stand mistakes like this. How are there scenes where DiCaprio looks younger? Perhaps 3+ hours invites the over scrutiny but scorcese is asking for it.How about the stabbing scene that is so poorly acted you can see no blood on knife or that the knife makes contact at all? Review that and get back to me.Dont make a film so long if you cant keep it interesting.",positive
676,"Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" delves into a haunting chapter of American history, shedding light on the Osage Indian murders of the early 20th century. Anchored by a stellar cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, the film navigates the intricate web of greed, deception, and tragedy that unfolded amidst the newfound wealth of the Osage Nation.Set against the backdrop of Oklahoma's oil boom in the 1920s, the film explores the sinister machinations of white businessmen eager to exploit the Osage people and their lucrative oil reserves. DiCaprio delivers a standout performance as Ernest Burkhart, a man torn between loyalty to his family and his Osage wife, Mollie, portrayed with grace and depth by Gladstone. Meanwhile, De Niro mesmerizes as the cunning and ruthless William King Hale, whose nefarious schemes drive the narrative forward.Scorsese's masterful direction brings the era to life with breathtaking cinematography and meticulous attention to detail. From the sprawling landscapes of Oklahoma to the intimate moments between characters, every frame is infused with a sense of authenticity and urgency. The film's epic scope is matched by its runtime of nearly three and a half hours, allowing ample time for the complex interplay of characters and themes to unfold.At its core, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a gripping tale of injustice and resilience, as the Osage people fight to protect their land and way of life in the face of relentless exploitation. While the film's pacing may test the patience of some viewers, its richly drawn characters and thought-provoking narrative offer a compelling exploration of America's troubled past.Despite its ambitious scope and powerhouse performances, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" falls short of achieving true greatness. The script, while solid, lacks the depth and nuance needed to fully engage the audience, and the pacing occasionally falters, particularly in the film's slower moments. Additionally, some may find the subject matter difficult to stomach, as the film unflinchingly depicts the atrocities committed against the Osage people.In the end, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a commendable effort from Scorsese and his talented ensemble cast, offering a haunting reminder of the injustices perpetrated against indigenous communities in America's not-so-distant past. While it may not reach the heights of Scorsese's greatest works, it remains a compelling and important piece of cinema that demands to be seen and remembered.",positive
677,"Killers is a great movie. But it's a great movie with some flaws.Not being familiar with the story and history, I was prepared for something more of a tragedy of government exploitation of native Americans. To be clear, government indifference isn't omitted, but it isn't front and center. The story revolves instead around the banal evil of commercial greed, and its impact on the Osage people.The acting is fantastic, with DeNiro and DiCaprio turning in deep performances. And, with Lily Gladstone delivering a haunting, tragic, and ultimately strong performance.I found the movie to be long, but frankly captivating. I found myself being relieved that there was still plenty of time to unwind the story.As to the flaws, I will only say that the movie depends a touch too much on sympathy for the devil, which you quickly realize is not the devil you assume. It also treats the native Americans as wholly naive and childlike. While this may have been true, it leads to a sense of discomfort with repeated bad choices or acquiescence with evil people that the native characters go along with.Overall this is an impressive film with a dark beauty and painful tragedy, but one that won't please everyone.",positive
678,Welp. I was looking forward to this & it's just my opinion & I know that's what makes the world go round because everyone has different tastes but I was.....UnderwhelmedSome solid acting & it's probably just me but I couldn't get DeNiros Max Cady out of my head. I closed my eyes a couple of times while he was speaking and all I could hear was COUNSELLORRRRRRRR!!!!Leo was spot on as usual but after the courtroom scene it's like here's old time radio with a recap. It could be just me too but I didn't see the chemistry between Molly & Ernest.As a Canadian I'll do the obligatory I'm sorry.....it just didn't do it for me.,positive
679,"All right, this movie is far too long for one sitting, so treat it like a miniseries and watch about an hour or an hour & 15 minutes at each sitting. It actually breaks down pretty naturally that way: the setup; the Osage fighting back against the murders; and the conclusion.Using this tactic should overcome the problem of the movie being on the bloated side, with too many scenes that drag on too long and too much repetition. If you're not getting sick and tired of it because you've been staring at the screen too long, you can appreciate the ""padding"" as more historical color, of which this movie has plenty.It's a very good movie but I'm not surprised to see it was shut out of the Oscars. It's not the best.",positive
680,"Martin Scorsese's (The Departed/Hugo) Oscar bait from last year detailing the white murder spree inflicted upon the oil rich Osage during the early part of the last century. Focusing on returning veteran Oscar winner Leonardo DiCaprio who comes home to be taken in by his duplicitous uncle, played by Oscar winner Robert DeNiro (up for Best Supporting Actor here), who gives him the tale of the tape as it were & encourages him to marry into an Indigenous family, w/Lily Gladstone (up for Best Actress & favored to win since she's already snagged the Golden Globe) being the object of his ardor. What follows during a 3 Â½ hour run time is a bleak account of what happened as various white players would outright kill into wealth w/DiCaprio urged by DeNiro to slowly kill Gladstone (she suffers from diabetes & insulin has just come on the market, so he begins to taint her dosage) even as her own sisters fall by the wayside. Finally getting the ear of President Coolidge by the Osage community, US marshals are unleashed to investigate, led by Oscar nominee Jesse Plemons, things finally start to turn w/various individuals arrested who start to turn on each other. While I admire Scorsese's desire to tell this particular story if you're a film connoisseur as I am (& he most certainly is) you can pick any random 1950's oater to see First Nations tribes being massacred on the reg just to quench the Manifest Destiny thirst by settlers so after a while you get what the director is going for but aren't we there already even by a glancing blow of some historical research? To quote a seminarian friend of Scorsese (who I saw interviewed in a doc about him) applied to his epic, 'too much Good Friday not enough Easter Sunday.'",positive
681,"The film isn't a happy clappy or traditional crime drama. It's an historical recreation of a shameful period of human inhumanity.The acting is uncomfortable and realistic and really makes you ponder the story.There isn't anything comfortable about this film it's about concentrating the mind onto the actions of white Americans belief in the own entitlement to resources irrespective of the original ownership.I must confess at times during the film, not least early on, I was wondering what exactly I had let myself in for. Slowly it grew n me until I did begin the real feel the power of the film.Nice helpful ending put it into context.",positive
682,"Big fan of Scorsese, major fan of Leonardo. DiCaprio and Robert DeNiro. What I liked was the built up, slowly leading to the courtroom, and then it all went downhill. Not sure why Scorsese decided to narrate the ending via a play or theatre. It could have been better if I as a movie goer, could feel the downfall of King Hale and how Ernest felt even more disappointed with how he was being used / manipulated towards the end. I was hoping someone would tell him about the insulin instead of me finding out via the so-called play. It has a great story, great character built-up but that ending really didn't do it for me. Just my humble opinion.",positive
683,"This film, which is based on a book by the same name is a true story about the Osage Nation. It takes place in 1928 when the group found oil in their land and became very wealthy, due to the laws at the time however they had to have white legal guardians to manage their money. This leads to the deaths of many Osage people because of the greed and discrimination from the Americans. Throughout the picture we follow main couple Ernest Burkhart, a white American returning from the war, who is now living with his uncle, a reserve deputy sheriff and Mollie Kyle, an Osage who has rights to the oil because of her family. During the film Mollie tries everything In her power to stop the epidemic of murder, consuming her people and Ernest, who is working for his uncle and together are exploiting the natives must decide if he cares more about the money or helping his newfound family. Overall due to the two lead performances by DiCaprio, and Gladstone, Deniros captivating villain role as William Hale, and Scorsese's direction, this movie was well made and an enjoyable watch that transported us to the past to learn about this dark and barbaric moment in history and provide us a glimpse into a different culture, language, and way of life.",positive
684,"Let me start by saying the obvious fact,Martin Scorsese didn't 100% succed to do justice to the book his film is made by.This is the first time,for me anyway,when the book is way better than the movie adaptation.Now...I don't say that the film isn't Oscar worthy,but it could have been done better given the fact it 3 hours and a half long(the ending is porly adapted and changed in some places than the one in the book).The actors are great but in the case of Leonardo Dicaprio,he played other roles better than this one. His best villain role is the one from Django Unchained.Still...Killers of The Flower Moon is a better Oscar competitor than Barbie, but the Best Picture will surely go to Christopher Nolan film Oppenheimer.If i would try to describe Scorsese latest film,I would say that it is just like those superhero movies that he described as not being cinema films...are good and enjoyable but not great.Overall,Killers of the Flower Moon is just another film added to the Oscars list,with a great story as well as amazing actors but it's made in a sloppy way and it does not achieve the same feelings as the book did.P. S. Hope this is Martin Scorsese final film,every film he released since 2013 up until now aren't half as great as his first masterpiece films.",positive
685,"For many years, I have considered myself a huge Martin Scorsese fan. During lockdown, I participated in a couple of film courses, one of which featured Scorsese films. This was a real eye opener for me as I realised I adore a select few of his amazing films: (Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Casino, King Of Comedy and Taxi Driver) and, too a degree: (Mean Streets, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, The Age Of Innocence) but many of the rest were pretty terrible (I'm not going to list them all!).Killers of the Flower Moon had a decent enough premise, the exploitation of a group of wealthy native Americans, by unscrupulous white folk, and in fairness, the style of storytelling wasn't bad. It all went wrong for me in the laboured repetition which dragged the obvious storyline out for hours and hours to the point that I had lost any interest in the fate of the principal characters, to the point that I became so bored and frustrated that I left before the end. The current fashion for films over three hours is ill judged. Bring back the days of shorter, punchier films with decent editing, something for which Scorsese and Schoonmaker were famous for.",positive
686,"I agree with others who have noted that Scorsese seems to be struggling with brevity and perhaps even directness in his storytelling. On the other hand, the performance by Robert De Niro was in my very humble opinion one of the finest he has ever turned in, and I have seen every single Minute he has on film. Similarly, this new actress who is exploding on the scene, Lily Gladstone., is simply a phenomenon of nature. She is effortless and frankly, I think she enhances DeCaprio's performance immensely. She essentially gives Leonardo someone to play off and their ""dance"", especially when they are alone in the bedroom, it's just simply a wonder.",positive

688,"I really wanted to love this movie but I couldn't help focusing on things I felt were missing.Lack of character development for the white cast. Good development for Osage, BUT missing more meaningful background on them and the beauty of their culture. You never really understand what Molly is truly thinking. Coupled with no subtitles for so much banter. Sure, some ambiguity is good, but there was way too much.So many opportunities for jaw dropping, stellar cinematography that didn't happen. There were a couple great shots, some really cool tracking shots, but so much flat lighting. There could have been INCREDIBLE depth in the look of this film. That was a HUGE bummer.Dialogue was severely lacking. Literally everything was ""because of the head rights"" never anything much deeper. King just repeats the same stuff for 3 hours.Ending seemed kinda rushed and forced. They threw in a bunch of talent at the end that was never utilized to their fullest. I felt like you could tell that the end was all shot first in production because Leo's character was more like Switch Blade and felt cheesy.Why did they have to rush to kill everyone so fast and so sloppy? Well because of the head rights, of course. That's it.I WANTED to love this movie and I couldn't help focusing on everything that wasn't there.",positive
689,"I will get the negetive part out of the way first. Is it too lengthy,sure it is. And I don't want it to be short. Because every minute of this haunting retelling was required to make the watcher feel atleast a fraction of the pain which was suffered by the Osage people. Lily Gladstone gave one of the best acting performances of the year. I don't think any other artist could have conveyed this heartbreaking tragedy perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio again proves he is the perfect guy to play the role of the villain. Well we can't call him that directly because he marvelously played such a morally weak charecter this is the first time I saw him do this. Also de niro may he never retire. Even at this stage of his career the acting range he posseses is phenomenal. Each time he was on screen he became the center of all the hatred and malice and was the perfect antagonist. And lastly Martin Scorsese is the greatest living director,his work just keeps getting better. And I really appreciate it that he still gives so much heart into his movies.",positive
690,"My husband says he hates Dicaprio so much now, that it must be a proof of good acting. We waited for the movie to watch it at home, because I didn't want to miss any bit of it by going to the bathroom in the cinema. I'm a forever Scorcese fan, so 8* for
me. I really enjoyed all the information and and ""extra"" scenes that some people talk about as ""useless"" or boring. Until the very end I wasn't sure if Dicaprio's Ernest is actually (pardon me) retarted so he isn't understanding what is he a part of, or that he's doing it all consciously. Absolutely loved Mollie, another great actress on the scene.",positive
691,"Really well made film that tells the story of the greed of the white man (in this case Americans).A story seemingly airbrushed from history of the poisoning, and murder of the Osage in Oklahoma.This film pulls no punches
Lily Gladstone in an Oscar worthy performance, she conveys so much range with a glance a smile and fear and hatred.Leo is great too, although Eric Roth has written him like Forest Gump without a lot of the charm
Roth also has used newsreel here to tell the story and like FG it works.DeNiro is imperious az Hale, having just enough restraint not to overshadow the film.He will battle with RDJ for best supporting actor.This film will vie with Oppenheimer as best film and direction.For me Oppenheimer is the better film but both these behomoths are head and shoulders above anything else I've seen
3 hours and 26 minutes with a slightly rushed ending.Gosee this in the theatre if you can.",positive
692,"In the myriad of films, included within western genre there is this new addition with Di Caprio and Deniro at the center of it all. The story is very interesting and the characters feel real, while I would have reservations (issues) with Robert Deniro southern accent :). It is unique in the sense that it shows a more profound interaction between the characters included to be close friends with the Indians, it does show more interesting historical and relational background into the Indian American culture, while maintaining its spectacular bits and pieces.A really good movie I would say if you are into that type of stuff, enforced by the terrific acting of the two main players (especially Leo), allowing for a very interesting drama to develop although I would be disappointed by the ending.",positive

696,"The driving force of this 3h 28m Martin Scorsese crime drama, made on an epic scale, is indeed its source material that revolves around the Osage Indian murders. David Grann's non-fiction book (of the same name) delves more into the crimes committed against the indigenous community in Osage County and the subsequent FBI investigation. Scorsese, while narrating this tragic series of events, focuses more on the love and eventual betrayal that occurs in its backdrop. So, the film's protagonists are indeed real-life antagonists. Now, here are some thoughts:1. Lily Gladstone's performance is a tour de force, no doubt. As Mollie Kyle, right from the moment she lays her eyes on Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), to her physical and psychological suffering in the latter half, it's no small feat. There's that cheery playfulness in her eyes in her first interactions (with Ernest), and those very same eyes indicating lost trust in her husband in that final post-courtroom scene; I'm completely SOLD! It was emotional, it was revelatory in the subtlest of ways.2. Leo's Ernest is pictured as a greedy guy right from the beginning, and the writing (by Eric Roth) thankfully doesn't paint him in broad strokes. We see him transitioning into a someone who can go from pretending to be a loving husband to a cold-blooded murder-planner. Funny thing here is that, when Jesse Plemons' Tom White from the FBI shows up in Osage County to investigate the murders, he says it's a direct order from J. Edgar Hoover - another character played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the 2011 Clint Eastwood film. Another instance of absurdity was when Plemons (35) kept referring to DiCaprio's (49) character as ""son"" - something you'll pick up only once you've watched the film.3. Robert De Niro's William K Hale carries a bitter coldness right from the start, and when he showcases his ruthless side, he's absolutely riveting. The stance between Hale and Ernest keeps changing as the film progresses, eventually leading to a splendid prison confrontation scene featuring the both of them. It's almost an acceptance of the turn of the tide, and both the actors are terrific in that particular scene.4. Brendan Fraser shows up late, and he was giving off major Paul Heyman vibes (if you watch WWE!). It was good to see him in a Scorsese film, period.5. The film really makes you feel the passage of time, and each character's death is given due space to sink in and the gravity of the crime is wholly felt. That being said, I desperately wanted to see the film told from Mollie's perspective, and while the right set of actors get the most screen-time, this occasionally leads to lessened impact when an indigenous character is killed off, owing to the lack of layering.6. Rodrigo Prieto's panoramic frames are more noticeable in the film's first hour and in a scene that features a raging fire, and otherwise, the film is razor-focused on its key characters' faces and body language. Oh yes, there are a lot of close-up shots. Robbie Robertson's score (his last, before his death in August 2023), plays a major role in conveying the heartbreak, grief, and loss of the Osage community.Endnote: The closing aerial shot is a beautiful tribute to the Osage people, and looking back, I feel the film needed a bit more of that vibrant, joyous representation.",positive
697,"Set in 1920's Based on David Grann's best-selling book, Killers of the Flower Moon takes place in Oklahoma during the Osage Indian murders, a series of mysterious killings targeting the indigenous Osage people who became wealthy due to oil discoveries on their land.

698,"Martin Scorsese is technically the best director working today. His films are made with precision and skill. Unfortunately his recent films also come with bloat.The running length is an unfortunate impediment to the Killers of the Flower Moon. Primarily made for Apple TV, maybe Scorsese should had made a mini series rather than an overlong movie.Based on a factual book by David Grann. Scorsese who loves westerns has essentially made one set in the early 20th century. It is all about greed and the murder of the Osage people of Oklahoma.William Hale (Robert De Niro) is the local political boss who has hatched a scheme to steal the oil rich reservation land from the Osage tribe. He appears to be a trusted friend of the Osage nation.Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) was his dim nephew. Hale got him married to an Osage woman Mollie Burkhart (Lily Gladstone.) Primarily to inherit her oil rights after her death. Hale and Burkhart slowly poison her with insulin.Hale ordered the deaths of other members of Mollie's family so the oil rights go to her. Hale conspired to stop any investigation until Washington sends in one of their own investigators to examine the spate of deaths.This is a story that needed to be told. It could had been done with 60 minutes easily lopped off.There is no doubt to me that the film has problems. It is all De Niro and DiCaprio. The Osage people are cyphers. Mollie is an interesting character but is then sidelined as she wastes away.It needed a perspective of one Osage tribe member leading the fight against Hale. That they knew what he was up to. That was missing.",positive
699,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a riveting film that sheds light on a haunting true story. Martin Scorsese's direction is masterful, capturing the essence of the era and delivering a visually stunning experience. The performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro are exceptional, showcasing their immense talent and dedication.The film's narrative is compelling, delving into the shocking events surrounding the Osage Indian murders and the subsequent FBI investigation. It skillfully navigates the complexities of racism, corruption, and the struggle for justice. The screenplay is well-crafted, effectively building tension and keeping the audience engaged.Visually, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a spectacle. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the beauty of the landscapes and the eerie atmosphere of the crimes. The production design and costumes transport viewers to the 1920s, immersing them in the time period with meticulous attention to detail.However, the film does have a few shortcomings. At times, the pacing feels uneven, with certain scenes dragging on or lacking necessary development. Additionally, the sheer magnitude of the story and the large ensemble cast may leave some characters feeling underdeveloped or overshadowed.Despite these minor flaws, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" remains a powerful and thought-provoking film. It examines a dark chapter of American history, highlighting the resilience of the Osage people and the fight against systemic injustice. Scorsese's direction, coupled with outstanding performances and stunning visuals, make it a must-watch for movie lovers and history buffs alike.",positive
700,"Having not read the book that Killers of the Flower Moon is based on, I can't say conclusively that the movie would have worked better if it had also told the story from the Federal Agent's perspective. I suspect that it would have, because all criminal investigations have a natural propulsive quality to them that pull you in. True crime stories are addictive because viewers want to experience the thrill of the investigation and hopefully see justice served in the end. The problem Scorsese and co-writer Eric Roth reportedly had with using that structure is that it would have relegated the Osage to the periphery and placed white men as the central figures of the story (as both villains and heroes). However, in placing Mollie and the Osage at the center of the events, the story loses nearly all of its dramatic tension as a result. The movie explains who the bad guys are, what they are doing and why from very early on, and the story unfolds from there without any real surprises to it. The audience is asked to witness each killing (or mysterious death) until the federal agents eventually arrive to put a stop to things at the two hour mark.Curiously, the narrative approach doesn't pay off as expected because the movie still ends up spending most of its time focusing on white characters. However, the movie still has enough going for it that makes it worth seeing. The movie is beautifully photographed and the overall production design is outstanding. It features another handcrafted score by Robbie Robertson that slyly accentuates the deceitfulness of the story. De Niro delivers another classic performance as a Scorsese villain whose entitlement knows no bounds. Gladstone is a revelation as Mollie, a multi-faceted character who makes us feel the anger and despair that wracked the Osage for years. DiCaprio's commitment to playing against type as the dimwitted Earnest is admirable, but I often found his character too stupid to be credible. Jesse Plemons is a pleasant surprise playing against type as the deceptively sharp Agent Tom White. Through it all, Scorsese tells the story with an apologetic fascination, where the tragedies blur together like a slow-motion stabbing. Killers of the Flower Moon ultimately succeeds is as an honest portrait of a shameful period in America's history, where the (white) men behaving badly are nothing more than greedy, brutal thugs. Its a good movie that aspires to greatness but never quite reaches it. Recommended.",positive
701,"This film is absolutely phenomenal in every single aspect, however it could have benefited from some trimming. Before I continue with my review I would like to commend Robert De Nero's exceptional performance, he is the most terrifying and manic movie villain I have ever seen. Every single scene is made with love and attention to detail, mainly due to the fact that the cinematography and direction is exceptional. I won't spoil the plot but the way it unravels is extremely satisfying however I feel the film could have definitely used some further editing to tighten up the longer sequences. There is no reason for this film to be three and a half hours long and better pacing would have definitely helped improve my score to a 10. The movie as is, is not boring by any means however some sections feel unnecessary and dragged on. As a film lover, this film was a breath of fresh air however I can see why casual movie goers have left mixed reviews. This film is very long, so just make sure that you are well rested before you go and watch it. The story is filled with melancholy and will leave you filled with anger and despair. I'm happy that this story was told, and no this is not a movie where all white guys are stereotypically bad. It deserves to be watched so please go into this film with an open mind.",positive
702,"A beautiful movie that had to be made to put in perspective how the people of the Osage Nation were murdered one after another to still their sacred land, their culture, their black gold & their dignity, about time someone took care of this publicly. Of course it had to be no other than Martin Scorsese who had the guts to do it.White people have been responsible of destroying & desecrating Native Americans separating from their homeland, their rituals, their spirituality & their soul.

703,"First regarding the title, some Native American tribes refer to the full Moon in May as the ""Flower Moon"" because flowers spring forth across North America in abundance around this time. ""Killers"" refers to those who were killing Native Osage members as a means to get at their royalty money from the discovery of crude on their lands.This is a long movie, right at 3 1/2 hours. I found myself wishing it had been closer to 2 hours. Not that there is any fluff in the running time, it just takes lots of patience to stay with it for that long.Leonardo DiCaprio is Ernest Burkhart, an actual person involved in all this, it is easy to look him up online and read what his fate was.Robert De Niro is William King Hale, also an actual person involved in all this, his details are also easy to find online.Lily Gladstone is Mollie Burkhart, the wife of Ernest, also an actual person involved in all this, her role is a major driver of the story and the actress was nominated for an Oscar for her role.From my brief web searches it appears that what is presented in this movie is very faithful to what actually happened back then. In essence white men would move into the Fairfax, OK area after crude oil was struck, and find an Osage woman to marry. Then, if the Osage heirs gradually disappeared eventually they would enrich themselves as only surviving heirs by marriage. Most deaths, being on Osage land, were not investigated. Ultimately the newly-formed FBI through the initiative of J. Edgar Hoover went into Osage Nation and got to the bottom of everything.Good movie, we watched it at home, streaming on Apple+.",positive
704,"Like most films with a director and cast of this caliber, it was well done - just not very entertaining. It dragged a bit and seemed utterly farfetched at times, even if it was a true story. Some things just seemed to defy logic. But at the end of the day the stars did there job - good acting, decent dialogue and direction. Just felt a bit empty and odd. Would have appreciated more character depth and storylines just seemed to show sequence of events rather having powerful scenes or plot developments. I would put this near the bottom of all his films, which are classics for the most part.it was messed up story and sad at times but left some meat on the table in terms of emotion and Native American culture.

Especially Di Caprio's wife. Run away from the movie. Whoever recommends it to you is not your friend.Because it doesn't have a nice soundtrack. I don't understand who thinks it's a good movie.

706,"Gilbert Grape gets manipulated by a guy named King Robert Deniro into killing everyone with money in the Osage Nation.

Anyways, it turns out Gilbert Grape isn't much of a medical scientist and people keep getting in the way of his knives and bullets, and everyone else succumbs to terminal hangnails. You might think that would make someone like his wife suspicious, but she turns out to be a pretty good sport about the whole thing.I think the lesson of the movie is ""What goes around comes around, except that sometimes it doesn't come around, it just comes near for a minute and then you die in an Oklahoma trailer park or Arizona nursing home and the person whose immediate and extended family you murdered for thousands of 1920's dollars divorces you and gets remarried""; that's the lesson here.It's long, but has good pacing.",positive

708,"Hollywood's depiction of oil-rich Indians gets steadily more sinister, from the genial cameos in the silent De Mille Forbidden Paradise, through indigenous custodian Pedro Armendariz in the 1947 Tulsa, to the exploitations of Giant and the fifties Cimarron. Nothing there to compare with the grimness of the new Killers of the Flower Moon, a real downer this one.Martin Scorsese, approaching the end of one of the movies' most impressive careers, takes what he does with a not inappropriate seriousness. It's about ninety minutes before we adjust to the dim color scheme and the initially genial Robert De Nero's plot which the audience is likely to know from the advance publicity. The montage of native American bodies, getting dumped in the mud, pretty much sets the tone, complete with open-air autopsy and grave robbing. There's the motif of sinister looking Europeans pouring from the rail line, becoming part of a menacing winning of the West. We get a mention of the 1921 Tulsa race riots, where blacks are the victims.At three hours plus, Scorsese fields his two super star regulars at the head of a massive unit. We thought Jack Fisk (Phantom of the Paradise) was dead. Scenes like the striking opening downwards shot of the tree branch roofed lodge are set against the severe Masonic meeting room. It comes as a surprise to find cameraman Rodrigo Prieto (Barbie) representing a later generation.The Eric Roth and David Grann plot follows the parallel stories of Leonardo di Caprio back from the WW1 trenches, and the Osage Nation, who looked like having the last laugh when the sparse land, they'd been re-settled to, proved to be gushing Texas Tea. They become the richest nation per capita on earth - scene of gleaming black, oil-splattered celebration, which foreshadows the climaxing dance figures outlined in the shimmer of fire.Attention settles on Bob's nephew De Caprio running a hire car service in the muddy street frontier city, that would have been in character with the De Mille film. Lots of scene-setting, like the main street vintage car race or the vision which has the red-painted spirit warrior come for mother Tantoo Cardinal. This brings Leo into contact with Lily Gladstone, daughter of one of the new rich Osage families, whose share of revenue is growing as her relatives die in mysterious circumstances. Despite her inexperience, Gladstone's authenticity comes through from the ""handsome devil"" scene they improvised. ""Squaw Man"", that's something I'd never call another man."" The marriage, marginalised children, TB diagnosis and De Caprio's inept setting up De Niro's succession of murders by sub-human henchmen, bribed by a red Buick Roadster insurance scam, are contrasted with the tribal leaders seething with rage at the lack of a recognisable enemy they can fight.By the time Gladstone gets up from her sickbed to join the tribal delegation to President Hoover, audience sympathies are inflamed and it takes some delicate handling to retain status for De Caprio. A Scorsese festival interview cites the Montgomery Clift character in The Heiress as his model. The game has changed. Time was only the enterprising or the privileged few got to see these. The buzz here is watching quiet-spoken proto F. B. I. Man Jesse Clemmons (Power of the Dog) matching genial De Nero as the grotesque plots unravel. This black comedy carries us into the re-staged True Life Radio Program finale, complete with actors striking up the sponsor's Lucky Strikes and announcer Sorsese having the last word.One-off films, which give masters of their craft a chance to work on important subjects, are pretty rare now. We ought to value each one.",positive
709,"This is a sad story and should be depressing, but there's a way to add some light to the darkness, and this movie did not do that. Not even a little. Nothing about how it is today either. Are the Osage still suffering? I did some research before watching the movie, and saw that they at least had some court victories. Maybe at least there will be public interest now, and there will be more stories that shine a light on today.DiCaprio was pretty convincing playing a guy that's not very smart. The actress that played his wife Molly was phenomenal. She was the best actor, imo. DeNiro did well, and some of the supporting actors were strong. The movie makes you realize how much harder life was then, and they connect it to the the Tulsa Massacre, Black Wall street.",positive
710,"Scorsese has dedicated a huge portion of his career capturing some of the most vile dregs of human scum to have ever really existed on film, all of whom were men who were driven by greed, but none of his movies were actually solely about raw, unfettered, irrational, pathological greed quite in the same way Killers of the Flower Moon is. Where Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street are more about living the high life and becoming addicted to the status that ill-gotten wealth brings, and Casino and The Irishman was about the alienation living in the fish bowl of a life in organized crime forces one into, and money is the ultimate motivating factor in driving each of these film's main characters into the situations that those respective movies aim to explore, Killers of the Flower Moon forces the object of money itself into every single crevice of its 200 minute running time. It's at the center of every single conversation, every conflict, every motivation, it bonds and then eventually breaks every relationship depicted in the movie, explains every action, overrides every emotion, no love in this universe is stronger than the desire for money. And that desire for accumulating money goes beyond satiating any material need, it's pathological, unending, with no reasonable end point in sight. There's never a point where there's enough. Entire cities are build, purchased, and owned, there is nothing left to spend that money on, but the greed is boundless, even as hundreds upon hundreds of bodies pile up and all of those exorbitant inheritances continue to accumulate into fewer and fewer hands, one man will not stop until he owns literally all of it, not resting until every native is struck dead and all of their wealth stolen, a point made painstakingly clear as Mollie mourns the death of her last remaining relative, and looks out into the crowd of funeral attendees only to find every single face looking back at her is white. White buzzards picking at the corpse of her culture and people, all of them massacred in the name of money.",positive
711,"The art of filmmaking is also about being able to tell a great, breathtaking story in a limited amount of time, on all kinds of subjects. Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director, but for his love of cinema he forgets the viewer, like many others (Scott, Aronofsky and many others), he made a film for himself, he certainly has the right to do so, but I didn't buy it. Everything was almost perfect, the actors*, the direction, the cinematography, the music, the editing, but it was not only too long, but distant, trying to say so much that it just wasn't enough to absorb and keep your attention. Eventually you almost started to not care about the Native Americans. You knew from the first moment what it was about, what was going to happen, it was just a matter of how ""perfectly"" it was going to be portrayed... a difficult film in every way, even for the viewer.",positive
712,"Exciting journey into the heart of mysterious events in the 1920s in northeastern Oklahoma, told through the lens of the Osage tribe and their tragic losses. Scorsese's direction, though typical of him, delicately balances emotions without falling into melodrama or manipulating the audience. It all looks simple and real, at times chillingly realistic in its violent scenes.Visually, the film doesn't introduce revolutionary elements or experiences, so given its three-and-a-half-hour duration, this achievement can leave a strong impression even at home, without regret for missing the cinema experience.The ensemble cast shines. Lily Gladstone and Leonardo DiCaprio stand out, alongside the consistently excellent Robert De Niro. Lily delivers such a strong, deeply emotional, and natural performance. DiCaprio masterfully portrays a complex role. His character isn't clearly defined as a hero or a villain, demanding a top-notch performance to stand out, which Leo achieves at a high level. De Niro, a proven master in villainous roles, doesn't disappoint this time either with his brilliant interpretation of a greedy criminal. Considering this, all three Oscar nominations are almost inevitable.Despite its lengthy runtime, and being a crime drama with very stretched scenes, some may say unnecessarily long, I always found a charming quality in them, even humor... I believe many will see all of this as excessive length, which I didn't feel, unlike 'Oppenheimer,' which runs for three hours and has a more dynamic and faster-paced plot. Additional musical or dialogue accents could elevate this work to a masterpiece, but even without them, this is an exceptionally successful adaptation of a book and a true tragic story. One of the best films of the year? Definitely!",positive
713,I'm into history and war movies + horror and scary movies! I love a lot of them but this one takes the gold on History/War Movies! One of the very reasons is because it was filmed in Oklahoma and I want to go! Don't care about the runtime of 3 1/2 hours. I kinda like it. Better than other movies I've seen like The Patriot. If I could compare even though I love horror movies. I'd have to say this one beats most/some of them. Why do people not like this? I just don't get that. I mean this is sad I'll give them that but it's still awesome movie. I love history movies and war documentaries. Really and truly.,positive
714,"As ""Killer of the Flower Moon"" (2023 release; 206 min.) opens, the Osage tribe is burying a pipe, whine lamenting the fact that the Osage is being assimilated into the white population. In a parallel story, Ernest has just returned from WWI and is ready to work under the wings of his uncle, nicknamed King. And to top it all, Ernest gets to know Mollie, an Osage woman... At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest oeuvre, don't just call it a movie, of producer-writer-director Martin Scorsese, working once again with both Leonardo Di Caprio (as Ernest) and Robert De Niro (as King). I had expected a movie about how US settlers (mostly whites) had dealt with Native Americans, almost to the point of extermination. This is not what this movie is about. It happens to involve some Native Americans, but it's really about how some bad people who want/need more money, are plotting to try and rob the wealth of others. Neither King nor Ernest couldn't care less that Mollie and her family is or isn't Native American. They just are after Mollie's family wealth. For all we know, they could have been white, block, brown, yellow or red. All that aside, it's a good movie for sure. But its running time didn't need to be 3 1/2 hours. This movie was alas also the last score from longtime Scorsese collaborator Robbie Robertson, who passed away a few months ago.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. It was released in US theaters this past weekend. The Tuesday early evening (discount) screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not attended well at all (exactly 6 people in a very large theater). If you are a fan of either Scorsese, DiCaprio or De Niro, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",positive
715,"Way, way too long. Some building of drama leading to some sort of climax would have made the length seem worth it? DiCaprio not the best choice for this role- too boyish to provide depth needed for his character, although he gave his best effort. His wife should have been less pretty to fit the character properly. Then the sternness and stoicism she reflected would have been more poignant and believable. But it always seems the Golden Rule of movie makers is to provide a pretty face to sell more tickets. Well Meryl Streep proved them all wrong on that score, at least. Robert DeNiro proved to be his usual scoundrel, but without much depth, which was the fault of the screenplay, he ran with what he had been given to the best of his ability. Reminded me of Snidely Whiplash- no complexity.I had high expectations for this movie, and was very disappointed.",positive
716,"Spoiler AlertThe storyline of ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is intricate, involving a multitude of characters. The intertwining of interests with historical factors makes it challenging to grasp every detail of this racially motivated massacre. However, it is precisely this complexity that enhances the enjoyment of watching the film.Martin Scorsese has underscored two key points in various interviews regarding the movie. Firstly, the film is not focused on identifying the killer but rather questions the innocence of individuals within the group (with an obvious answer). The trailer concludes with a shot of people gazing at the camera, accompanied by a voiceover asking, ""Do you see the wolf in this picture?"" This creates a clever investigative effect. However, in the actual movie, when this shot occurs, the people are looking at Ernest. They use their gaze to exert pressure on Ernest before he decides, as he may be on the verge of exposing his uncle Hale. The most unsettling aspect of the film is not the existence of a ruthless murderer like Hale, but the fact that everyone is implicated in the massacre, yet no one steps forward. The film dedicates substantial time meticulously explaining how Hale executed his murder plot through intermediaries because Scorsese aims to show the audience that this is a collective crime, perhaps even the crime of an entire community (White Settler), and not solely the actions of Hale and his cohorts, even if not everyone directly planned or participated.Moreover, Hale is not the super-smart mastermind type. Undoubtedly ruthless, he is not the cunning criminal consistently outsmarting the police. In the movie, when the FBI initiates its investigation, capturing Hale and his associates isn't a formidable task. Hale's primary ""villainous charm"" lies not in intelligence but in his extreme greed, leading him to lose all sense of conscience. This trait is either innate or developed over time, favorable circumstances, and an environment of accumulating power and wealth, making him bolder, as if it were more of the latter. In essence, this conclusion suggests that Hale and the group of similarly greedy individuals are not a one-time combination but a scenario that can be repeated. Whenever the timing is right, anyone has the potential to become a wolf, part of the collective crime. That is the terrifying aspect of this tragedy.Scorsese frequently highlights a second crucial point: the heart of the film lies in the relationship between Ernest and Mollie, their love forming a central theme. Scorsese approaches this narrative with great care, recognizing it as a significant tragedy for the Osage tribe that demands utmost respect for historical accuracy. In contrast to other characters, Ernest is intentionally shrouded in the least information, allowing for more room for creative interpretation. During the script rewriting, the focus shifted from FBI's Tom White to Ernest. While Ernest may remind us Henry Hill, the protagonist in ""Goodfellas"", his character is more reminiscent of Kichijiro portrayed by Yosuke Kubozuka in another masterpiece ""Silence"".Ernest's love for Mollie parallels Kichijiro's loyalty to God, both genuine yet repeatedly betrayed due to their inherent weaknesses. Similar to Kichijiro, who would betray God at the first sign of danger but later confess for forgiveness, Ernest grapples with the conflict between his love for his wife and obeying Hale's orders. Despite his deep affection for his wife, he continually inflicts harm on her and her family, driven by his own weakness, resulting in constant betrayal and a life without principles. Scorsese, however, views this as an authentic reflection of human nature. When Kichijiro's actions endanger Japanese Christians and overseas missionaries, and Ernest harms his wife and family, both situations pose risks to those around them. Yet, their beliefs and love create a sense that they are not entirely irredeemable, eliciting pity. In one of the most impactful moments in the final scenes of Killers of the Flower Moon, Mollie visits Ernest after his conviction, offering him one last chance. This underscores Mollie's profound love for Ernest and the Osage tribe's unwavering trust in humanity, even in the face of adversity. However, Ernest, unable to overcome his inner weakness, persists in lying, causing Mollie's heartbreak. If the previous discussion emphasized the most terrifying aspect of collaboration for the sake of interests within human communities, the microcosm of individuals reveals the scariest facet of human nature: the weakness preventing honesty, even when confronting their dearest loved ones, in stark contrast to the Osage tribe.History unfolds in diverse ways before our eyes. The ""Easter egg"" at the film's conclusion, distinct from typical superhero movie endings, embodies Scorsese's profound introspection and reflection. It serves as a significant warning to humanity at large. This resonated profoundly with me during my initial viewing of ""Killers of the Flower Moon"".",positive
717,"This is based on a horrible truth about how the Osage were robbed, killed and covered up incriminating evidence against Osage murders. It is another proof how Native Americans were prejudiced on. It's sad that in 2023 we are still learning new history about our ancestors such as the boarding school skeletons that are being discovered. This movie will help educate people and I hope people will do their research to continue to learn truths. I especially love all the true Native actors and actresses casted, it is detrimental when Native Americans are protrayed by non-Natives- Tatino being cast In Spirit Rangers with all Native crew and cast is amazing- she is awesome and Alaska Daily- another great Native cast show but unfortunately didn't get renewed.",positive
718,"Whilst being beautifully shot and well acted, I cannot remember a film being so brutally slow and long. It's 4 hours my butt will never forgive me for sitting in that cinema seat. If the KGB wanted information out of me, all they'd have to do is make me do that again... I'd crack immediately.As harsh as that sounds, I can see why people liked it - the cinematography was delightful and Dicaprio and De Niro were in full flight and a remarkably vulnerable and eerie performance from Lily Gladstone might we worthy Oscar shouts.Perhaps a less self indulgence from Scorsese and chopping things (a lot) down to less than 210 minutes might have this film bearable. It's a shame as the delivery seems to ruin a good story..",positive
719,"I'm fed up with the whining about the film's length and dark premise. In this day of advanced social media, anyone could discover these things prior to going and opt instead for a 90minute romcom or anime.The film unfolds slowly, drawing in its viewers as it peels back layers of ugliness. We watch, alternately disgusted and mesmerized, as these men do whatever they want with impunity. Molly's unending quest for justice leaves us cheering as she realizes the truth about her husband but it's a hollow victory. The final scene is sheer brilliance in its depiction of white society's view of horrible atrocities. Let's make them a spectacle!DeNiro and DiCaprio are both superb as they always are, and they have great supporting cast members. But the real star is Lily Gladstone. Give that woman an Oscar!",positive
720,"You can't deny that this one film that stands out. The problem is that it is relying on the names rather more than all else, but credit to Scorsese for bringing an original and important story to the big screen.What we have is a dark thriller on screen based around a true story that centres on the manipulation and murder of a oil rich wealthy family from an American Native Indian community around the 1920s. It's different that's for sure. The film centres around Leo DiCaprio who marries a wealthy Native American lady in order to infiltrate them, guided by his manipulative uncle Hale played by De Niro.You can't deny the acting is great, and it looks good too. However, the big elephant in the room in the runtime! It's around 3.5 hours long, and really there's many people who won't be able to stomatch that in a cinema. Personally, I found that I was able to manage the time, as really the film is engrossing, but they could have lopped off around 90mins without much loss in impact. As this was produced by Apple TV, then you could argue that they cared more about it being a long film like a streaming box set. So it's like crudely hammering square pegs into round holes here.I like the film, just could have been more succinct. If anything, I think there was a lost opportunity for Scorcese to make a final epic film (with his age, it's possible this could be his last epic but you never know).I think it's worth a viewing but it's worth checking reviews of it before you start if you aim to watch it in the cinema. Many might not find they are able to stomach the length of the movie in one sitting in a cinema.",positive
721,"DiCaprio's acting was very good, portraying a simple, greedy, affectionate and cruel character. Plemons also produced a very good performance, though his character is limited to a stereotypical investigator. Other actors are less impressive, portraying only single dimensional characters, like a cunning uncle, a loyal wife or a cold blooded brother.The movie was shot in slow pace deliberately, not sure if this helped in creating the 1920's feel. It took me a long time to warm up and figure out what the story is about. The movie showed Osage people living like British upper class and the ordinary white people worked as chauffeurs and servants, acting respectfully around them. I don't know if this was true, given the systemic racism and persecutions against the coloured people in the US at the time.Some of the minor details are also unrealistic. The street of a small town was as vibrant, busy and tidy as New York City. The 1920's motor vehicle run so smoothly and quietly on dirt road like Toyota Camry on bitumen, and house indoor settings, furniture and even door knobs were so refined like those in 1970s. Oklahoma's Rural areas only started to have electricity in mid 1930s, but halfway through the movie, candles were replaced with generous electric bulbs, even covering entire streets.The movie presented itself as a serious production about Osage Indian Murders. However there are so many things that just don't feel right. Has COVID caused such drop in movie quality in Hollywood?",positive
722,"From the beautiful opening scene, this movie grips the audience and pulls them into the world of the Osage Nation in the 1920s. From then on, the film unfurls into a fully realized vision of the period, and tells a horrific, yet largely unknown true story about the mass murder of Osage people by the very men that they trusted enough to let into their land and infringe on their culture. Scorsese presents a wealth of details related to Osage culture, including their burial ceremonies, wedding ceremonies, language and way of life, which makes it all the more tragic when we witness their world slowly crumbling under the rising tide of murders committed by men whose only worship is material.Scorsese's direction here is largely restrained - despite the occasional jump cuts and voiceovers as well as some surprising tributes to silent film, all in service to the story, the movie doesn't go for any big effects nor does it rely on any point of constructed narrative revelation - we know the main source of evil (William K. Hale, portrayed brilliantly by De Niro in yet another demonstration of his incredibly wide range and his nephews, including one Ernest Burkhart, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in a wonderfully nuanced performance that can reasonably land him another Oscar), and we know what their intentions are: to maneuver into the families of prominent wealthy Osage members and kill them off one by one for the inheritance. The movie doesn't play like a mystery in this sense, and it can't neatly be classified into any particular genre. Instead, the focus is on maintained on the characters, and their complex interactions. Scorsese doesn't feel the pressure to ""move the camera"", as he himself stated - this, perhaps paradoxically, frees the film from any sort of artificiality and lets it flow freely and pull us deeper and deeper into the world he and his cast and crew have constructed. I wholeheartedly disapprove of the criticisms that the movie is ""too long"" or ""boring"": point me to any particular unnecessary scene that serves just to pad the runtime. Every scene in this film is justified and builds on logically from what came before, racking up the tension and tragedy. The music choices in particular are fantastic and complement beautifully the events on the screen.Lily Gladstone gives an outstanding and stirring performance as one of the victims of Hale's plot, Molly, whose relationship with Burkhart provides the heart of the movie. The great success of the film is in the fact that it doesn't play like a simple morality tale and provides each character with depth and clarity to the point that we could imagine all of them as equivalent to the real life people they are based on.However, the movie, primarily through its ending scene, rightfully reminds us that it is merely a representation of what truly happened and that the extent of the true horrors and tragedies could never be fully communicated through film.The two scenes that communicate, for me, the emotional crux of the story are: the scene in prison just before Ernest Burkhart is set to testify where Burkhart finally chooses to do the right thing and break off from his uncle, and Hale utters the tragic truth that people, the fickle creatures that they are, will likely forget the story of what happened in a few years. It will turn into ""just another tragic thing that happened"". And the second scene is where Burkhart and Molly have their last encounter and he lies to her for the last time before she leaves him.The film feels hugely relevant to the present time, what with the wars that are presently going on as well as a particular incident that happened in my country that is analogous to the events of the movie, where tragedy happened for the sake of profit (and I am sure there are countless others in other countries). I think that we should try to keep this film and the truth about what happened with the Osage people alive, in order to prove Hale wrong.",positive
723,"Historical Depth: The film delves into the little-known Osage Nation murders of the 1920s, shedding light on a dark chapter in American history. Director Martin Scorsese masterfully captures the period setting and immerses viewers in the world of the Osage people and the corrupt forces seeking to exploit their oil wealth.Strong Performances: The cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, delivers powerful performances that bring the characters and their struggles to life. DiCaprio's portrayal of the troubled Ernest Burkhart and De Niro's turn as the ruthless Tom Huston are particularly noteworthy.Visually Stunning: Scorsese's visual style shines through in ""Killers of the Flower Moon."" The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the vast landscapes of Oklahoma and the intimate details of the characters' lives. The film is a feast for the eyes, even while dealing with a heavy subject matter.Cons:Pacing Issues: Some viewers might find the film's pacing slow at times, especially in the first half. The focus on character development and historical context can feel meandering compared to Scorsese's usual fast-paced thrillers.Graphic Violence: The film depicts the murders and violence against the Osage people in a realistic and sometimes disturbing manner. While essential to the story, this might be upsetting for some viewers.Lack of Moral Clarity: The film presents a complex moral landscape where the lines between good and evil are blurred. Some viewers might find this ambiguity frustrating, especially given the historical context of the Osage murders.Ultimately, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that offers a unique perspective on a dark period in American history. However, its slow pacing, graphic violence, and moral ambiguity might not appeal to all viewers.Remember, these are just some my potential pros and cons, and your own opinion on the film might differ. The best way to judge ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is to watch it for yourself and see what you think!",positive
724,"I know there are lots of fans of Scorsese and I completely understand it, but it's not a reason to think every single movie he does is a masterpiece.Of course I've loved, for example, The King of Comedy, Taxi Driver, The Wolf of Wall Street or The Departed. But a general negative aspect I can tell of Scorsese is the lack of emotion in some of his movies and the tendence to drag the story too much.And this happens in Killers of the Flower moon, a TOTALLY boring, dull, unemotional, uninteresting and contrived plot shown in the screen with mid performances, yes, because I couldn't care less about any of the characters, they didn't have a soul. Deniro was simply awful, DiCaprio hateable, and his wife in the movie was depressing.What happens here is that Scorsese is absolutely big-headed and thinks that every fanboy will love any of his movies whatever he puts on the screen, he might seem untouchable, but his age definitely finished him.He couldn't fill this movie with even a small amount of excitement, and the same happened with The Irishman, he repeats the same thing again and again, just like this or the typical murders of handgun shots at the back (like in his mob films). Scorsese mixed up a lot of uninterest things in a movie that, in my opinion, was an insulting way to bore to death.To add up, the ending seemed like it was just put there to end the damn movie for once, and so this man could appear on screen. It was a stupid dialogue of what happened with the characters that I couldn't care about at all.You know it's trash when u get out of the cinema without rememering any part, not a small dialogue sticks to you and you have a feeling of insult, that the whole producers insulted you.",positive
725,"Revealing the deepest scars in human history, let's take 3 hours to reflect and mourn these bloody lessons.We all know that every peaceful generation has a painful past; even though we live in a comfortable environment, we must not forget the lessons left by our predecessors. Many tragedies continue to unfold, constantly reminding us of what ""human nature"" truly entails-showing us the consequences of letting emotions and desires rule! I believe these reflections are the most profound after watching.For those friends reading my thoughts, you might have an inkling of my film preferences and tone in recent years. Yes, in my list of favorite directors, Martin Scorsese's latest work, ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" is a nuanced, meticulous, and authentically portrayed drama! A quick heads-up for those planning to watch: this film doesn't have mind-bending plots, dramatic twists, emotional rollercoasters, or commercialized action scenes - it's not a popcorn movie!It is precisely by removing those ""dramatic"" elements that the film effectively highlights the emotions and reflections it aims to convey. Set in the last century within Native American tribes in America, the director deliberately leaves behind sounds of that era, such as the rustling of wind in nature, horse carriages, clock chimes, and even retains characters' breathing sounds during emotional fluctuations. The absence of grandiose music allows the audience to deeply immerse themselves in the atmosphere! The characters in the story also naturally come to life within this realistic ambiance. My favorite actor, Leonardo DiCaprio, departs from his usual intense emotional expressions and adopts a more composed and restrained approach, perfectly showcasing the complex emotions forced upon the protagonist by circumstances. As for the female lead (portrayed by Lily Gladstone), with minimal dialogue, her superb acting expresses emotions entirely through facial expressions, bringing to life a character who is shrewd and capable yet kind and tender, a performance that I believe has a strong chance of competing for next year's Oscar for Best Actress.Furthermore, the story avoids commercialized ""additions"" for audience service, choosing a more steady and ""lifelike"" narrative approach, reinforcing the audience's experience of the ordinary amidst uncertainty, making it ""thought-provoking."" Visually, the film uses long shots and wide angles that I personally love to present the simple and beautiful local customs against the backdrop of human nature running rampant, creating a strong contrast and adding a sense of conflict.Many issues ultimately trace back to human nature-should we be driven by emotions or engage in rational thinking? Sometimes, one person's actions impact not only themselves but also their family, town, nation, or even the world. Perhaps it's time for all of us to carefully examine ourselves...This is a masterpiece that requires one to sit down and truly engage in solitary contemplation and reflection. Personally, I believe it's a much-needed piece for transitional justice in today's world, especially considering the current events in Ukraine and the war in Afghanistan, which deeply resonate with the themes of the film.",positive
726,No idea what others are saying about the length - but if you're someone giving this movie less than 8 you're just being ridiculous - I see 5s and 4s... seriously? So this is worse than garbage blockbuster action flicks? Please.Scorsese has made his Schindlers List - it's a slow burn with a huge emotional punch - the three leads are all brilliant. Most impressive is Molly - she holds the whole film together emotionally and should get a seriously good look for an Oscar. DeNero was the best he's been in 2 decades and DiCaprio was flawlessly grey... do you like him or hate him? Impossible to tell. Absolutely brilliant film.,positive
727,"I understand why they focused on Ernest's (Leonardo DiCaprio, it's safe to say his acting was solid and terrifying, I don't think he's meant for this role though) perspective. Because it is the most effective way to tell the outline for the series of brutal murders in the Osage Nation. He's innocent (in a way) and therefore he's the only reliable narrator. Respectfully, it's not the wisest way to tell their emotional journey throughout. Scorsese could depict Mollie Burkhart's (Lily Gladstone, what a phenomenal actor), or any other victims' point of view. But he didn't. I guess he wanted to be true to those people and he didn't want to make a story of what he never knew. In a way, it's a respectful attitude, but at the end of the day, it's just a story about a white man who has a typical victim mindset, which is incredibly hideous to look at. AND the hero of the story is Tom White (Jesse Plemon) the lawman, which makes this film worse. Because true heroes are those indigenous people who went through hell (fear of being murdered), or grief (from their family being killed). It almost seems that his character exists to neutralize White people's sin.What a great film portraying endless, tedious dialogue between Ernest and Hale (Robert DeNiro), right? They abandoned the responsibility to characterize those people. Although this is their story, Scorsese treats them like extras, which is not more than emphasizing how great DiCaprio as an actor is. This is a true story, in that regard, this film is neither good nor bad. Just polite. The scene I can't forget, in which Ernest admits that he took Mollie in the car by his own choice. I understand Scorsese wanted to say their love was true. But this also just raises questions: Why did Mollie (who is such a thoughtful woman) marry Ernest (who is extremely dumb and easy to manipulate) knowing he just loves money? If he really was such a loving husband, why was he able to try poisoning the love of his life? There are lot of context that was missed.",positive
728,"The fact that it is a true story adds to the compelling and complex nature of this film. It is a throwback to the western epics, such as The Searchers that Martin Scorsese enjoyed as a young man. As Ernest Burkhart Leonardo Dicaprio gives the performance of his career. The only other movie star to grace the screen that I can see playing such an easily duped character with such rich internal complexity would be the late Steve McQueen. Lilly Gladstone is very interesting to watch and brings a proverbial light to Mollie that only she could. Robert DeNiro is playing an evil Southerner, but it is much more nuanced than his performance as Max Cady, so he reminds us of why he's Robert DeNiro and avoids falling into the trap of playing a caricature of evil. It's just an excellent story and film. I loved Jesse Plemmons as Tom White. The set design, costumes, direction, and screenplay are all amazing. People complaining about the length of the motion picture, I do not understand what they're complaining about, I would have watched a five-hour version.",positive
729,"First off, like most reviewers have noted, there were some excellent performances in this movie. Leo was really good as usual. Deniro had one of his best performances in years. And the cinematography was excellent as well. The story itself was basically a snooze fest. No tension, no character development. The run time was overly long and totally unnecessary. The timeline was also hard to follow as apparently years skipped by in the change of a scene. The story progressed at a snails pace, and since by the first hour you knew exactly what was going on, the next two hours were a slog. The last 30-40 minutes the pace picked back up when Jesse plemmons shows up with his fbi team to help crack the case. Then the ending is rushed, and the viewer is left with the insult of getting a synopsis as a member of a theatre audience. An audience that is watching some sort of live radio show telling and acting out the story we just watched. I had no reference to the book, and didn't even know until afterward that this was a true story. Scorcesee did the author, and the real life players no justice with this telling. If it weren't for the acting this love is a 2-3 stars tops. A poorly told and poorly executed movie.",positive
730,"Honestly this has to be a fiction if not, it's one incredibly unbelievably sad story of greed, evil, and just disgust. Someone said Robert was miscast. They couldn't be far from the truth. The fact that I grew to hate every single white person in this movie goes to show how amazing they did to portray their characters.I can't imagine what Leonardo and Robert must have felt playing their roles so perfectly, because it was just dead cold. To act like you don't know who is killing your wife's family members, to look in her face and lie to her that you love her yet you are killing her!, that's just pure devil!How people completely miss the whole point of this movie but crying over how long it is etc beats me.",positive
731,"Did Martin Scorsese intend to remake Goodfellas as a western? Because this story of a young man pulled into organized crime, hurting even those he supposedly loves (his wife and children) sure makes a case for 'yes.""
It is not that the story is unworthy of being told. It is certainly a series of events about which people should be informed. And the film checks a lot of boxes: the acting is good, the sets are great, and the cinematography helps the viewer feel part of the landscape. The film itself is OK. Not one of Scorsese's better efforts, though. And because the film is told in a way that mirrors Goodfellas it feels like imitation, or at least an exercise playing with genre.This film is a disappointment.",positive
732,"It another flop by scorsese and not his worst film of last 10 years and yey the story was deeply moving and the directors ego tried to make his own schindler's list like his friend made. The problem is the film had really poor quality acting and could not capture the stories true vision. The main actor Leonardo was amazing after he finally become character, but the first half of movie was badley managed and his acting questionable. It just did not feel like a true story and the initial story staging was poor. If it was edited better it could have been given a chance and Martin scorses apearing in movie was just dum and a really bad choice. Its a shocking story and he could have just told us he veiws on an extra dvd or in an interview and let the movie stand alone and tell its story.",positive
733,"Watching this movie was like sitting in my high school history class sluggish after eating lunch, awoken by a brilliant teacher (Martin Scorsese) telling an enthusiastic and exciting story about what happened to the Osage Tribe. Martin executed this story with great detail with a camera like nobody else with no thrills or tricks needed, 'Just tell the damn story'. Sitting at home in my robe made this movie so enjoyable to watch, being able to move and not become stiff. For the love of great storytelling with a camera, Martin and Steven were born to be directors; no last name needed. I hope Martin wins Best Director; he so much deserves it. Thanks, Martin, for paying homage to the Tulsa Massacre. I gave this a 10, but there are not enough stars in the world to rate how good this movie is. Everyone acted out their characters with conviction to bring truth and tell a story of one of human nature's ugly flaws, GREED!, at any cost.",positive
734,"The true story behind the film is incredible. The history of the Osage people is as fascinating as terrifying. The actors and cast are magnificent, and the acting is at a high level. But this is the only thing that kept me in front of the screen for 3 hours.The scenes are very drawn out, filled with boring dialogue, and lack symbolism. We are constantly being shown new characters and not even trying to reveal them. A close-up of his face for 15 minutes, and after watching, it is hard to even remember his name.The main character's motivations and values are unclear, as are most of the other characters. It's hard to get into the movie. Every new death just doesn't feel important.After watching it, I was tired not from the bloody story of the film, but from watching this picture itself.",positive
735,"Not a bad story but unnecessarily lengthy. Three and a half hours? Really? Someone with the caliber of Scorsese could have been more efficient in the use of everyone's time. There were absolutely moments of brilliant acting, and the cinematography was absolutely stunning, but the overall pace was so exhausting that I found myself grasping for enough energy to hang on till the end. Thankfully I found myself waking up during the final hour as the pace started to pick up. Overall, an incredible cast and a heart-wrenching story of one people-group struggling against another. But unfortunately, the same story could have been told in fewer hours.",positive
736,"A lot of people have watched this movie and loved it. But the people who hated it are missing the point. No one knows what the meaning of true cinema is anymore and that's why we have Scorsese making another epic, to remind us what cinema is. This movie is a MASTERPIECE, definitely a must watch,it is long but it's very very good. That's what the new generation doesn't understand,they don't know how to respect a good movie,who cares if it's long,it is still magnificent. KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is one of the best films of the year and decade and one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.",positive
737,"I am 70 and have seen between 6 and 7,000 movies in my lifetime. I know that Martin Scorsese is the greatest director alive but this film, somehow, makes his talent greater than that. It is as if he were a direct descendant of God Himself in terms of his perfection. As a work of direction, it couldn't possibly be better. In my personal list of the best 300 films ever made, I just placed it in the top 40 - but, ironically, I don't think anyone should ever watch it because out of all those movies I have seen, it is definitely the most depressing film I have ever experienced. I was sobbing in pain and empathy for the indescribable pain that Scorsese's super genius was able to convey to his audience from the screen. Also, I constantly wanting to walk out because of the pain but Scorsese's God like genius directing made it impossible to stop watching. Right now, having just seen it, I wish I were dead because of the astounding evil and pain that some of my fellow human beings are able to inflict upon other humans. It is so horrendously painful that I wish I were another species.",positive
738,"I really thought I would adore Killers of the Flower Moon since it has all the things I usually enjoy - Scorsese, DiCaprio, De Niro, a true crime story based on historical events, and a powerful narrative. However, I'm finding it surprisingly difficult to get through. I just checked to see how much time was left, thinking it must be almost over, but to my dismay, I realized there's still 2.5 hours left! ðŸ˜“ I usually have a decent attention span - I mean, I watched Oppenheimer, which was 3 hours long, and I was completely engrossed the whole time.Update: there's still an hour left. God help me get through this.Update 2: I almost cried while watching this movie because it just...would...not...end. It's finally over.",positive
739,"Martin Scorsese isn't one to slow down as he reaches his twilight years. In 'Killers of the Flower Moon,' he takes us to a specific time and place to tell a very personal story that is representative of the horrific mistreatment of Native Americans in the early 20th century.While this is certainly the main message of 'Moon,' the film is also a portrait of a man who rises and falls in the shadow of his uncle, and a portrait of a woman whose life is turned upside down. Pairing two esteemed actors like Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro is not always a sure bet, but they equally deserve credit for the parts they play in this story. But neither are able to measure up to the quiet confidence that Lily Gladstone brings as a member of the Osage tribe who must persevere in the face of many obstacles thrown at her by the intruding prospectors.In considering 'Moon' as a complete piece, it's hard to ignore the gargantuan runtime (nearly three-and-a-half hours). Yes, there are scenes that are ""must watch,"" but there are many stretches that make you want to reach for your phone. It's just a fact of life - it's easy to get distracted when things are slow-moving, and this is inevitable here. That said, 'Moon' is beautifully filmed and the dialogue is as balanced as it is biting.As made clear by the fact that it earned a best picture nomination, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a film that will rank highly in Scorsese's library for years to come.",positive
740,"Martin Scorsese brings us back to the big screen, another real case of crime and murder alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro teaming up. It is a story of deception and conspiracy with a well-written and detailed script, but with a very long duration that makes it require too much attention. It is Scorsese's habit to make very long films to tell his stories in much more detail. It's a pretty good film on a cinematic level and DiCaprio gives a very good performance. The film knows how to capture the conflict of the Osage Nation with those who only desire their wealth. Killers Of The Flower Moon is undoubtedly another good crime film with a shocking Scorsese-style story. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",positive
741,"This film had an enormous amount of buzz, and it was a darling of the professional critics. The runtime alone dissuaded me from watching it initially, and now, having seen it, I feel confident that you could see two better films in the same enormous span of 206 minutes. Perhaps if I'd gone in with lower expectations, I would have enjoyed it more.On the plus side, Killers of the Flower Moon is gorgeously shot and features a terrific score. The acting from De Niro and DiCaprio is, as expected, terrific, but it's Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart who steals the show. Despite the length, I do think the movie keeps your attention throughout. It creates a wonderfully realized world for its early 20th-century setting and features a wide cast of interesting secondary characters. Scorsese is, after all, a master storyteller.For the negatives, the movie features no real character development or plot surprises. Early on, it signals right where it's going, and then it goes there. The social commentary isn't remotely subtle. At one point, a character actually says it's easier to convict a man of kicking a dog than killing an Indian; there are explicit (and vocalized) parallels to the Tulsa massacre; the KKK marches in a parade.You get the idea. Indeed, you would have to engage in active avoidance not to get it. By the end of the movie, I felt as though I'd watched a well-shot, well-acted documentary about greed, racism, and historical injustice, which is fine and all, but it didn't make for the powerhouse drama that people kept billing the film to be.",positive
742,"In a 5-second-attention-span world, where the genre ""slow-burn"" has become synonymous with the word ""boring"", this reminds you that even a slow-burn movie can provide a soul-stirring experience, keep you at the edge of your seat and rattle you to your core.Triumphant, in every sense of the word. Seamlessly blends that classic Scorsese crime drama with a harrowing romance to create something bold and profoundly tragic.Lily Gladstone gives a riveting, soul crushing and undoubtedly Oscar-winning performance. Robert De Niro spanks the living hell out of Leonardo DiCaprio. Thank you Martin Scorsese for this cinematic gem.",positive
743,"Let me start by saying that Marti is one of the few cinema purists working in Hollywood who also embraces the avant-garde. Unfortunately, his late work is plagued by poorly structured, slowly paced stories with little or no tension. Killers of the Flower Moon is kind of a Crime Mystery without the mystery, structured more like a domestic drama. Scorsese appears to be more interested in the performance of his actors than the overall effect of the overarching narrative. It feels as though the individual characters are pulling the story in different directions without a clear objective-everything feels forced and out of place. Maybe it's the hypocrisy and pretentious nature of its characters, but honestly I was bored by the lack of nuance and tension, especially in a crime story. Killers of the Flower Moon is too straight forward and too bland. DeCaprio's character is too passive and inert to play against the ruthlessness and cynicism of Deniro's. And Lily Gladstone's character-the one with the will and power to defy him-is sedated through most of the film. There's a redundancy to the way things play out. The film is an exercise in repetition and a test in patience, further complicated by an exceedingly long run time.",positive
744,"Let's address the duration of this at the start. It's far too long and full disclosure I've split my viewing into three sessions. Maybe that offends the purists, this is Scorsese after all. He doesn't really make short simple films though does he and to be fair, this one is pretty great. We open in the 20s (can we still say that, now we're firmly in our own 20s). There's an oil boom in Oklahoma. On Indian territory. Making its people, the Osage Nation very wealthy. That's not going to last is it. Enter the white man. Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) back from the war, he's new in Fairfax. There to stay with his uncle, William Hale (Robert De Niro) who's got lots of advice for Ernest, but he doesn't strike me as the best mentor. He seems to respect the Osage, lives amongst them, keeps the peace as the deputy sheriff. But something stinks and it's not the oil. I guess where's there's money, there's people there to take it. Fairfax feels like the Wild West. Wooden buildings and dirt roads, horses, but cars too. It's like a playground for grifters. Ernest earns his keep as a driver. A taxi service. He picks up Mollie (Lily Gladstone), who's ""full blood estate"", meaning she's got Indian money and William smells an opportunity. Ernest seems a bit slow, but a nice guy. Truth is though he's not a nice guy, he is pretty stupid though and ruthless too. He's honest with Mollie, to a point. Which is just as well, she's sharp. They fall in love and William escalates his manipulation. The pace is slow to start, despite there being a lot going on, but his is a simple story of greed and being patient. Ernest, William and all the white men are like a cancer or better put, ""like buzzards circling our people"". The Osage see what's happening with the cunning, sneaky parasitic white man, but how to stop it. The cast is impressive, the score fantastic. It looks authentic as you'd expect with the budget this has. I mean what I know about this era is limited, but you're thrust right into the narrative of this world and it certainly looks faithful. Ernest and Mollie are the focus, but it's a clash of cultures. One that it's easy to take sides on, there's no mixed messages, even if DiCaprio is brilliant caught in the middle. De Niro is great too as the back stabling, scumbag villain, but no one outshines Gladstone, shes magnificent, understated yet powerful. Even when prayed upon. Insightful, she's the shining light of hope in an otherwise bleak tale, the one we hang our hopes of justice on. There's a tense unstated score that pulses away as things get more dangerous. It grabs you by the throat and helps you forget your arse has gone numb. With the FBI snooping (Jesse Plemons makes a fantastic FBI man) and other complications, things could get messy and they do. It's not really dawned on me whether we're dealing with historical facts here, but I'm guessing the characters are dramatised, they feel like Scorsese gangsters, but the backbone is probably based in fact. Yes it's long, but stick with it, it's great throughout and brilliant at its end with some lovely touches to round out the story.",positive
745,"Di Caprio and DeNiro were both miscast. Di Caprio should have played King Hale and DeNiro shouldn't have been in the movie. Scorsese has a wheelhouse for great films but this story does not fit in it. He also should branch out with new actors, instead of constantly using the same ones in every movie he makes. The set and set designs were perfect, and every other actor in the movie was terrific. However, it seemed at times that Scorsese was changing the mood to be too light of a tone or just not as serious as it needed to be. The story definitely needed to be told, I just wish it would have been done by a different director and properly aged actors.",positive
746,"I created an account just to write review. This movie was way too long with pointless scenes that could have been deleted. I can only imagine that there was no studio control over Scorsese allowing him to create a ""directors cut"". Movie reviews have been destroyed by studio bots who create false reviews. This was a really bad movie.saying anything less to deceive potential viewers just to waste their time is borderline criminal. Disappointed as this heartbreaking story could have been told in a concise manner that doesn't make the viewer hate this movie. Some of the actors weren't good. The movie could have been cut in half.",positive
747,"Advantages: First and foremost the acting was exceptional. In particular Di Caprios performance, Lily Gladstones and of course the veteran De Niro. I thought the music used really demonstrated the vibe of the early 20th century and the atmosphere of native America. Cinematography, similarly was superb. However the one thing that stood out to me was the intensity of the storyline and build of suspense throughout the whole movie. Especially when the detective from Washington arrives. The reason I haven't given it a 9 or 10 is simply because I have movies such as Interstellar and Goodfellas as a 9 and for me Killers of The Flower Moon is great but does not exceed these masterpieces and for me can not be regarded as on the same level as.",positive
748,"What sets ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" apart is its unflinching willingness to confront the uncomfortable truths of America's past, presenting a story that is not only historically significant but also deeply relevant in today's discussions about racial injustice and inequality. The film does not shy away from depicting the greed and corruption that led to the Osage murders, nor does it gloss over the profound impact of these events on the victims and their community.Scorsese's collaboration with his long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, ensures that the film's pacing and narrative structure are meticulously crafted, weaving together multiple storylines and perspectives into a cohesive and compelling narrative. This careful construction allows the audience to explore the complexity of the events and their impact from various angles, ensuring that the story remains engaging and informative throughout.In ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" Scorsese has created a film that is both a historical epic and a human drama, a work that challenges the viewer to reflect on the darker aspects of American history while also celebrating the indomitable spirit of those who fought for justice. It is a film that is as thought-provoking as it is visually stunning, a testament to Scorsese's unparalleled ability to tell stories.",positive
749,"Sooo, where to start?Let me start with the end. I have never seen a movie being wrapped up in a jiffy like this one.What on earth is up with this ending? Who wrote this stuff.Was the budget cap reached? Were the writers on strike when nearing the end of this movie?If you are looking for a tattered end, this is your movie.Be prepared it is going to be a looong sit to make it to the end as well. The story slowly develops to make the point it wants to make.Sloooowwww. Did I mention slow?The cinematography is on par and so is the music.It takes some getting used to to see Leonardo act the way he acts. Overall he does a good job.But the ending... This ending will haunt me for the rest of my life.",positive
750,"So far this year my favourite film still is and will likely remain as Babylon and one of the things I loved most about that film was the fact that it was a stylised representation of a real piece of history. With that being said when I first saw the trailer for killers of the flower moon it was the fact that it was a seemingly real/based on real events story that appealed most to me. The story is essentially a murder mystery set across 1920's American (Oklahoma to be precise) and focuses on one particular Native American family after oil is found on their land and as a result they start to be murdered one by one but by whom is the question?The actor I've heard get the most rave reviews so far for their performance in this film is Leonardo DiCaprio. Come to think of it when doesn't he get rave reviews when he has a new film coming out? He's obviously one of if not the most famous working actor in the world right now and based on the high quality of the films he's been in alone you could say he's earned it. Personally for me though, I don't think that was the best performance I've ever seen him give. It's not up there with the likes of Wolf of Wall Street or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood not for me anyone. He plays Ernest Burkhart, a man returning from war who is looked after closely by his Uncle (Robert DeNiro). His character doesn't seem to use his own brain very often and instead just does what his Uncle tells him which leads him into trouble but I'll leave that there. It's a strong performance from DiCaprio and he definitely steals some scenes but I feel I've seen him played better and more interesting characters ultimately.In contrast, Robert DeNiro was the stand out for me as the Villainous Uncle William Hale. He truly embodies this seemingly good guy who's friends with the natives but has ulterior motives and plays both the good and bad sides of the character perfectly. Robert DeNiro is again obviously one of the all time acting greats however I haven't been quite as engaged by one of his performances as I was here. Every time he was on screen I was trying to predict what the characters next move might be and it had me on the edge of my seat.Lily Gladstone was also a stand out as the native Mollie Kyle (later Burkhart). Mollie is seeing her family get murdered one by one and tries to get help from wider authorities before becoming too sick to help due to Diabetes. It's hard to say anymore about her character without spoiling the film.Finally the main selling point of the film the legendary director Martin Scorsese. Whilst I personally don't consider him the best director of all time I can certainly see why a lot of others do. His films are always full of details and fully fleshed out stories and characters, he also like any great director should has a strong understanding of all the elements that go into making a film. From lighting to sound to camera I get the impression he knows exactly how he wants his films to look long before shooting begins. I again don't think this is his strongest work, its by no means bad in any sense of the word and I do recommend seeing it however I just prefer his films such as the already mention Wolf Of Wall Street and Goodfellas more personally. I can't talk about this film without mentioning it's massive 3hrs 30mine runtime, it's the longest film I've seen in cinemas, a full 30 mins longer than Babylon. I don't think a long runtime is an issue with a film as long as it needs that length of time to tell its story and I just felt this film felt a little uneven at times especially when it comes to detail. I felt like we didn't get to know enough about certain characters while other characters we almost got a books level of detail about and I didn't think that was always required. I do feel it probably would have been a more enjoyable mini series overall but with that said it's still a largely gripping story accept perhaps for a couple of moments here and there and I think it's one that's worth seeing for the acting performances alone.",positive
751,"At 81 Scorsese is still able to deliver one of the best films of the year whenever he makes a movie. One of those rare talents that is unsurprisingly good whenever he puts something out. With Killers of the Flower Moon he is also not simply going over old or comfortable ground. Yes, it's yet another ""gangster movie"" but a very different one than any of his previous ones.In Killers of the Flower Moon, We have an exploration of the perversions of capitalism, masculinity and white supremacy that is as of the moment as anything in cinema. The story tells of the Osage Nation who finds oil in their territory, soon white men come to take advantage of this newfound wealth and take that advantage by marrying into Osage families, and in the case of this film, murdering any and everyone who stands between them and money..... I really wasn't aware that there is a tribal community name Osage tribe, and such a horrible and inhumanic tragic bloody tramautic unimaginable situation they have to face. Many people said that this film is based on a real life events based on a Osage tribal community who were severely brutally murdered, in a art of genocide mass killing murder. If i haven't watched this film i wouldn't have known it..... The film centres on the criminal white characters, led by Evergreen Leonardo DiCaprio and Maestro Robert De Niro, and some have criticised the film for not taking the Osage perspective as its main point of view. That would be a great movie, but it wouldn't be the film for Scorsese to make, this exploration of white male fragility is what he does best. However he does bring to light some spectacular performances by Native actors, particularly Lily Gladstone's long-suffering wife to DiCaprio, a shoe in for a supporting Oscar nomination. Most interesting in the film is the complex emotions of our thoroughly despicable killers. DiCaprio's Ernest, seems to sincerely love his wife, even while he damages her and everyone around her, greed knows no love or pity.....A MUST WATCH FILM....",positive
752,"Great concept. Fabulous cast and performances. Post WW1 frontier seemed legit. I tried so hard to like it, but it was just too darn long. Movies can't be 3:22. Cmon Marty!!!!! I even tried to watch it in like three episodes.....but that was a waste. I guess this is the best Hollywood can do right now. It's either super heroes or Indy films or marathon films by legendary filmmakers. I'm bummed man. Movies used to be epic. Amadeus.... Gandhi.....Cry Freedom.....heck Goodfellas. Now I go to the movies and I feel like I'm in some creepy basement with everyone in a recliner. Whatever men.... I'd rather rewatch breaking bad again.",positive
753,"I was excited about this movie since it had Scorcese and Leo. There are very few movies that miss with these two. This was great. It is a good paced, well portrayed look into the Osage Nation murders. The cast did an excellent job with Leo and Lily Gladstone really making the characters come to life and bringing the audience into what might have happened during that period. It really showed how cruel and heartless humans can be. A sign of a good movie is when it doesn't make you lose focus and this one kept the story going at a very good pace. I had to go rewatch it for more details. I think this one deserves all the nominations for the Academy Award since there was a lot of work put into this.",negative
754,"I am always suspicious of a movie full of big stars and a director. Unfortunately, my rule proved right again. Don't get me wrong, Bob De Niro and DiCaprio are good in their performances, but the movie is not there.Not sure what was the original plan, but someone forgot to decide what kind of movie it would be. It's not a comedy nor a drama or suspense. Surely it's not sci-fi. Looks like a bunch of scenes that just goes on and on for three and a half hours.Thank goodness I didn't go to the cinema to watch it.The question is: Why did Scorsese choose this? He has the talent, the money, time, and the actors.What a tremendous waste of money.The saddest thing is it's all there. It's a true story, a true crime.",negative
755,"Martin Scorsese is one of the most revered and famous directors of all time. You'll never see him make a popcorn flick, you'll rarely get a straight plot from him, and occasionally he'll do black comedy (the most recent being The Wolf of Wall Street). What you will get most of the time is something epic, something that throbs with energy and greed and irony and extremity. Killers of the Flower Moon (his latest) is epic to a point. I mean any film with a runtime of three and a half hours has to be labeled epic. That's the baseline. ""Can you find the wolves in this picture?"" Yes and um, they're salivating.But wait a minute, ""Moon"" is not great Scorsese but it is good. Heck, this is Marty's Gone with the Wind, his ""Godfather"". The breadth, width, and scope are impressive, the acting raw and reactionary, the camerawork whip pan-like (it is what it is and that's impressive). The storytelling? Well that's a different story (see what I did there). It's a little untidy and that's where I draw the line. The screenplay here by Martin and Eric Roth recycles itself, full of cupidity and hired hits and non-stifled characters that are sheltered. I get that protagonists in Marty's pics are sometimes bad people but this goes way beyond. Example: star Leonardo DiCaprio ""kills"" it as usual but you've got to wonder why anyone would fully root for his scrape.Based on a book of the same name, Killers of the Flower Moon casts DiCaprio and Robert De Niro as nephew and uncle involved in the murders of Native Americans via 1920s Osage County (that's in Oklahoma). Their scenes crackle and bruise, a sort of long-awaited reunion of when they together starred in 1993's This Boy's Life. Add a solid time setting, some cogent costume designs, and bright production values and you've got a newfangled Western that's as violent as it is morbidly repetitive. Hey, nobody is of the first water all the time. Scorsese almost succeeds brilliantly in shooting this ""moon"".",positive
756,"Boring , boring and more boring .... What a fantastic cast, unfortunately the entire plot is sleep worthy and doesn't get any better, from start till finish it's boring. This is pretty much white men bad , the Indians as clueless smucks and some Beverly Hills oil finding garbage thrown in between. Masons and klu klux clan what were they thinking ?I think I even saw the car from titanic in there... is this all Hollywood can come up with ?Disappointed does not even begin to explain what I think of this trash spewed out....I think that who ever wrote this script take a long walk off a short pier and ride off into the sunset, forever.",positive
757,I needed some of the gore along with the happy ending to justify it. The much needed happy aspects of the story might not influence the viewers from other countries the way they would've wanted it to (if they did). The feminism in the movie is happiness directed more than any existence of the will to fight when her husband couldn't be on her side. The husband had to give up on himself just to get her to get a divorce. The helplessness reminds me of remnants of it I've experienced as a brown man in the US. The emphasis on skin color could only be ignored in the context of sexual interest in women.,positive
758,"Yes, a movie with depth, great acting, and a great story. Now, I do think it could have been edited down a bit, but not an hour as some have suggested. This is real storytelling and character development. It takes time.I am typically a fast-action movie lover. If I read reviews that say, ""this movie is a slow-burn,"" that generally turns me away. Even so, the great acting, story, and cinematics carry the weight here. This movie should rule as far as awards this year.I am actually not a big Decaprio fan, but I have to say he hit the acting out of the park here. Lily Gladstone is amazing. Well worth an evening of movie watching.",neutral
759,"Overall enjoyed this film. Important historical event that I had never heard about but still a relevant and important part of history today. Fantastic cinematography and great acting, especially from Lily Gladstone. It did drag in a few scenes but overall Scorcesse kept me entertained. Music was great and emotional, especially at the end, was very poignant and made me cry.The story is what really shone for me and I think is a very important tale to know and it transcended film genres and think it's an important film for everyone to watch and appreciate. It really makes us think, how did we let this happen?",neutral
760,"Martin Scorsese's latest bum-number is a three-and-a-half-hour epic with a runtime that falls just shy of that of his previous slow-burn, 'The Irishman (2019)', and seems to solidify the stalwart director's predilection for long-form cinema that has your bladder practically begging to be emptied before the plot even reaches its midpoint. The film is long and you can definitely feel its length, but I can't say that it's too long for what it is or too long for its own good; it's just long, and that's all there is to it. It's never boring and none of it screams that it needed to be left on the cutting room floor, but it's totally understandable if its gargantuan nature is enough to put you off watching it. There's something unique about watching it in the cinema, though. When the credits finally roll after an incredibly bizarre 'text ending' alternative, it's undeniably rather funny to hear an entire room's worth of knees pop, backs crack, voices groan and bodies awkwardly shuffle to the nearest toilet. That's despite the genuine weight of the film's overwhelming sense of tragedy, which hangs over you like a dark cloud as its cast and crew are named on screen. Hearing others leave acts as a welcome - if slightly jarring - reminder that however heavy what you've just witnessed is, you haven't witnessed it alone.'Killers Of The Flower Moon (2023)' tells the real-life story of a series of unsolved yet (seemingly) easily solvable murders perpetrated against the Osage Nation after they've discovered oil on their land in 1920s Oklahoma. It's essentially a hopeless tale of white greed, entitlement and barbarism, as what seems to be most of the state's white population comes together in a vast conspiracy to systematically eliminate wealthy Native Americans one by one in a bid to strip them of their land rights and their money. Murder is used in conjunction with marriage to ensure the cash flows to those responsible for the deaths rather than those who rightfully deserve it, and nobody lifts a finger to stop it. This is the point of the piece, as the justice system fails even when it appears to succeed. It takes literal hours before anyone even begrudgingly does anything right, and we're forced into the perspective of one of the perpetrators of this long-running disgrace. Although Leonardo DiCaprio's dim-witted Earnest isn't the one behind the machinations we helplessly watch unfold (he doesn't have the brains for it, after all), he's undoubtedly keeps the scheme alive and kicking thanks to his keen combination of avarice, cowardice, ignorance and idiocy. I know that the point of his character is that he's a spineless moron who spends most of the movie bending to the insidious will of his uncle (Robert De Niro) while looking vaguely morose about doing so, but I found myself constantly questioning why we were in his point of view.While an argument could be made that forcing white audiences to exist alongside the white community doing all the killing also forces them to directly confront the horrors of their past and reckon with the fact that America was built upon evils like this, it also reduces the agency afforded to the film's Native American characters and is a perspective we've seen many times before. I know that in reality the Osage Nation were fairly powerless to prevent what was happening to them - no matter how hard they tried - and that a point-of-view character from within their community may not be able to drive the story as much as one from outside it (the villains do control this narrative, after all), but the actual protagonist doesn't make that many decisions of his own anyway and it's annoying that this is yet another film told from a white perspective when it practically screams to be told from a Native American one. This is dampened somewhat by Scorsese's tendency to capture his action from a distance, generating empathy by virtue of not directly judging anyone rather than by virtue of telling you who to judge and how, but it's still keenly felt because Earnest is the main character and that's all there is to it. The Native American characters are portrayed with respect, but they aren't in charge of their own story and - worse still - they aren't even the ones telling it. The narrative is supposed to be frustrating, a hopeless examination of historic misdeeds, but arguably feel the tragedy of the Osage massacre more if we were firmly in the Osage Nation's point of view (although it's still horrifically hopeless and hopelessly horrific as is).Furthermore, the picture doesn't give any of its female characters that much to do. It didn't have to be this way, either, because the perfect protagonist, Mollie (Lily Gladstone), is right there. Sadly, Gladstone's sturdy leading lady is relegated to the background for large portions of the piece, kept quiet both within the plot and outside of it. Her efforts to uncover the killers of her family are constantly undercut by Earnest and the others, but it almost feels as if the film itself is dismissing her attempts at agency simply by virtue of there only being one or two scenes told specifically from her perspective (an out-of-place narration scene that puts us in her headspace is one of the feature's highlights and makes you wish more of the story was relayed in a similar fashion). The women are almost only characters in how they relate to the men, even though they ought to be a massive part of this tale. It's not the worst example of this I've seen, but it's undeniably a very male-driven experience and it really shouldn't be.The feature sort of just says the same thing over and over again for two hours, then slightly rephrases things and repeats that for the next one-and-a-half. This is by design, as its intention is to bludgeon the audience with the harsh truth behind the so-called 'American dream' by never letting them escape from it. There is no relief, no Hollywood interludes, no allusions that what you're seeing is ever going to relent. The film knows what it wants to say and it has no hesitation in saying it. Two-hundred-and-six minutes is a long time to spend in the company of someone you can't stand, and Earnest is in almost every one of those minutes. Although he initially has an undeniable rustic charm and he eventually makes some decisions that aren't entirely awful, he's generally just a passive, weak-willed, greedy and two-faced individual who claims to love his family but only really loves the money his unscrupulous uncle keeps promising him. The central dynamic is often positioned as a kind of tragic romance, but it's actually just ongoing abuse. The white characters simply use their Native American neighbors, friends and family to further their own economic interests. It really is despicable, a vast conspiracy conveyed in hushed whispers, unspeakable insinuations, lazily covered-up crimes and a massive amount of collateral damage. The flick manages to get under your skin simply by fairly dispassionately conveying all this real-life carnage, while also crafting restrained yet believable characters that often challenge the audience to spend time with people they desperately want to see get their comeuppance.It's a testament to the strength of the performances that even the most awful individuals are compelling screen presences, with DiCaprio's leech-like leading man's toeing of the line between semi-sympathetic and utterly shameful being the primary reason he remains so watchable. De Niro's serpentine pseudo politician is often truly scary both in his more obviously sinister moments and in his performatively charming ones. Gladstone is perhaps the only truly sympathetic major character, a strong yet scared individual who endures so much pain it's a wonder she's still able to stand, and her performance captures the nuances such a role requires with ease. The supporting cast are notably strong and only one of them puts in a strangely distracting effort.The filmmaking here is generally of the highest order, even though I'd argue that Scorsese's direction is a little lethargic in places (when compared to some of his other work). The editing is on point, despite the occasional intrusive structural decision (the cutaways to random violence sometimes interrupt the flow of the film, though that's almost certainly their purpose), and the cinematography captures everything with an often painterly eye. Perhaps most impressive aspect is the period set and costume design, which transports you back to 1920s Oklahoma thanks to its truly tactile and immersive nature. Alongside the actors' salaries, this is likely where most of the $200 million dollar budget went and you can see pretty much every penny up on screen. I think that's what people mean - even subconsciously - when they say they don't make movies like this anymore. Budgets of that size are almost always reserved for action-based blockbusters and they're almost always spent on lavish special effects. I think everyone would benefit from more diversity in terms of what's afforded the time, money and talent that something like this is.Ultimately, this is an appropriately bleak and overwhelmingly long portrayal of a real-life tragedy that shouldn't go ignored. Although I believe it would be better if it was told from a Native American perspective, I can see why Scorsese decided to frame it the way he did. Plus, there's some weight to the idea that simply portraying these events will raise awareness of them. The flick is expertly crafted, wonderfully performed and almost consistently compelling (even if you do definitely feel its length). It manages to keep you engaged even as it refuses to give you a protagonist to root for, and feels decidedly distinct in its unwillingness to pander to audience expectation (i.e. Introduce a fictional element of hope). It certainly has its flaws and I'd hesitate to call it a masterpiece, but it's a good effort that proves Scorsese's still got it.",positive
761,"It was a good movie with one of the best images that i ever saw in cinema but don't whait for something crazy in the scenario. I think Scorsese is at his final scenarios so this printed in the movie. It was one action that the actors do in every second scene and almost made me bored. And the other think is that you make something so obvious so is necessary to make your actress understand that something is off, dont make them look stupid. If you ever see the movie i want to ask something to yourself,it was worth all the trouble and money that the actors pay in the movie? Or its just the try of make a movie enough and bad planned just to relish something in the market? After all it had a very interesting ending that was so perfectly created for this movie .",positive
762,"I wasn't too impressed with the opening of the movie with some of the quirky ways the camera is used and the story is told. The whole movie actually has a slightly pasty yellow look which I found off-putting, the roaming camera at times made it feel pretty modern and the old newsreel style clips looked wrong, the frame rate just wasn't right it seemed. The main problem with the movie is our main character just isn't that interesting, he's basically just a puppet, a tool for his uncle, and so naturally it's the uncle you want to get more of. It's hard to imagine this man actually being able to enjoy spending money even if he got it, he's a bit of a drag to follow. Robert De Niro really is the best thing about the film giving a great performances as a two faced gangster with a very dark soul. The film is slow and there's an awful lot of dialogue, I did find it hard to believe at times the characters were smart enough to get away with murder. The violence is done in a shocking way but without much emotion. The film somehow still manages to fall into it's share of tropes though it does improve slightly during the second half. You can't fault the art design, the costumes, it also tells an important story but overall it just could have been a little better, perhaps shorter. In the end you're mainly left just feeling quite sad.",positive
763,"I just finished David Granns book and liked it a lot. As in the movie it focused on white men instead of the Osage women. That works fine because it tells the story about americas biggest korruption and the birth of the FBI.The nonfiction book is build on research, it focuses on detective work and is even about journalism. Tom White led the investigation into the Osage murders under the command of the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation J. E. Hoover (yes, you heard that name before). First DiCaprio was cast in the role of White but preferred to play Ernest Burkhart.To see De Niro (as Hale) and DiCaprio great acting is really enjoyable, but at some point it should have changed focus to Whites and Hoovers story. It would have been a better movie if Jesse Plemons (what a great actor!) and DiCaprio had changed roles.An early version of the screenplay focused on federal agent Tom White, who led the investigation into the Osage murders, with DiCaprio originally cast in the role. Sure DiCaprio will get another Oscar, but Scorsese likes to film his acting bit too much. I am convinced the DiCaprio as White would have given a better story.I like long movies like Casino or Leones Once a time in America, still this one is has its lengths. It would have worked better as miniseries.",positive
764,"First the highlight of this very good film, which should have been a ten, not a seven. That was Lily Gladstone's understated, poignant interpretation of the character at the center of a compelling story told by a strong cast.Unfortunately Scorsese wrung much of the life out of this important historical narrative by treating every scene he shot as equally essential to his three and a half hour tome of a movie. The most difficult challenge of translating a book to celluloid is making decisions that capture the essence of the message in about 120 minutes. Not simply packaging double that material, because your ego does not permit you to leave anything on the cutting room floor.",positive
765,"In my opinion this film has leveled up to its expectations.The story telling is detailed and smooth at the same time ( JUST HOW I LIKE IT ) .. I mean, Have we expect less with Martin Scorsese as our director.I've watched it once, and I must say that one time was capable of getting me to see through the eyes of each character.William Hill ( the character played by Robert De Niro) is insanely complixed and got deep layers underneath of it, Compined with the wonderful performance of Robert himself that took us to old times, It's just amazing.Lily Gladstone also maybe booked her ticket to the Oscars.Reaching to, Leonardo Dicaprio.... this man is without any doubt one of the greatest of all time. He is a true artist, he made me laugh and cry, he made me love him and hate him, he's for sure the best actor on our planet.Watch this film only if you're hungry for a fat tasty film!",positive
766,"I was so engrossed by the book that I wanted the film to be as good and it isn't.If I didn't already know the characters and what happened I would have been confused by the finer but important details - the relationships and dynamics between the characters.First, what I liked. Robert de Niro,
it almost goes without saying, was excellent and Di Caprio makes a decent fist of another leading player, as does the actor who plays Molly. The whole ensemble is up to scratch. The Bureau of Investigation officers are the heroes in this and the lead officer superbly portrayed as a diligent, humble and conscientious detective. The vistas are engaging and this slice of American history is engaging.Perhaps the story could have been just a little bit tighter, or have I become accustomed to being spoon-fed my plot twists and moments of gravitas?I still fully recommend the film. It's a story that needs to be told and not forgotten, the victims needing to be rescued from the enormous condescension of posterity.",positive

768,"An absolutely phenomenal film, did not at all feel like 3 and a half hours long, it was paced so excellently. This is probably one of my favorite Scorsese films so far, he beautifully tells the tragedy that befell the Osage nation during the 1920s due to corruption, greed, and betrayal by the people who claimed to be on their side. Several scenes use symbolism derived from traditional Osage legend, which helps communicate the themes of this film extremely well.The acting is also superb, with leads De Niro, DiCaprio, and Gladstone delivering exceptionally great performances.I definitely recommend you watch this film, this is quite possibly my favorite film of this year.",negative
769,"In this beautiful film by Martin Scorsese, we delve into the story of Ernest Burkhart (DiCaprio), a World War I veteran who allies himself with his uncle William Hale (De Niro), setting off an intricate game of interests. Hale, self-proclaimed ""King,"" sees in Ernest the key to consolidating wealth in his family. The plot unfolds, revealing a complex relationship between Ernest and Mollie (Gladstone), one of the Osage sisters who holds vast fortune.The film stands out for its atmosphere laden with apprehension, immersing Mollie in justified paranoia, where trusting white people becomes an impossibility. The narrative highlights Ernest's moral fragility, portrayed masterfully by DiCaprio, while William Hale weaves a web of endless deaths. Mollie, personifying personal tragedy and the victims of genocide, emerges as the emotional epicenter.A misstep manifests in the casting of Lily Gladstone for the role of Mollie Kyle. Unknown to me, this actress, despite being acclaimed by most critics, did not effectively convey the sorrows experienced by Mollie in my perception. I consider it an error her nomination for the Best Actress Oscar for this role; her victory was considered certain, but she was rightfully defeated by Emma Stone. Furthermore, her beautiful face starkly contrasts with the ugliness of the real Mollie. Compounding the issue, the age disparity, with Lily being 12 years younger than DiCaprio, contrasts with historical reality, where Mollie was six years older than Ernest.The screenplay not only shines through its captivating plot but above all by the respectful and genuine way it approaches the cultural richness of the Osage people. The eminent director, renowned for his fascination with diverse cultures, dedicated himself to close collaboration with members of the tribe. Scorsese not only positions these tribe members in front of the cameras but also integrates them backstage, promoting genuine and enriching collaboration. This commitment aimed to ensure that the representation of their history and beliefs would shine through with accuracy and reverence. In this sense, the work is not just a cinematic account but a delicate tapestry woven with threads of authenticity and respect, where every detail reflects the filmmaker's dedication to narrative fidelity.Scorsese, with his singular ability, distances himself from any judgment or prejudice, revealing the people's beliefs in an authentic and reverent manner. A poignant example of this respectful approach is his portrayal of the owl, a sacred creature in Osage culture. Often associated with death and the spiritual realm, Scorsese seamlessly intertwines this conviction into the film's plot.At the 44-minute mark, one of the most sublime moments of the film unfolds: Byron Burkhart, Ernest's brother, rises from an outdoor bed and enters the house. The camera, flowing without cuts, follows Byron, keeping him off-screen as it traverses various rooms until stopping in front of Lizzie Q, Mollie's mother. Only at this moment does a cut occur, revealing a window. It is there that an owl appears and perches, then leaps into the room and flies towards the camera, occupying the entire screen. In this exquisite cinematic passage, Scorsese not only narrates but transcends, weaving an engaging visual narrative that celebrates the spiritual richness of Osage culture. Every camera movement, every subtle transition, culminates in this masterful moment where the owl, a revered symbol, assumes its importance in the narrative, adding a layer of meaning that resonates beyond the screen.Mollie stands out not only as a central figure but also as a symbol encompassing profound dimensions within the plot. The dramatic epicenter of the narrative is the love story between her and Ernest. This romance delineates Mollie's emotional journey in grappling with the magnitude of events. Gradually, she also comes to understand the role played by her husband in the destruction of her family.The plot unveils intricate layers of the human psyche, showing how Mollie reacts to devastating circumstances. She personifies the victims of the genocide systematically perpetrated by white settlers against the Osage, standing out as a symbol of suffering, especially within the context of her own family. The narrative goes beyond, unmasking the supposedly peaceful and well-intentioned facade of white men, notably Ernest and his uncle Hale, and revealing an underlying diabolical process.Mollie's story transcends not only her personal journey but also reflects the shared fate of many other genocide victims. The film thus rises above mere entertainment, evolving into a significant platform for reflection on profound social issues such as genocide, racial prejudice, and the persistent systematic dehumanization in contemporary society.Exploring his distinctive technique of alternating between narrators, the director leaves a unique mark on the screenplay, providing the opportunity for a character, at a singular moment, to detail their meticulous strategy and the feelings involved in carrying out an evil deed. Narrative mastery is further revealed when the chronology of the story is occasionally disrupted, transporting viewers to specific events, such as the shocking murder of one of the sisters. This method not only adds complexity to the plot but also intensifies the coldness and cruelty of the act, introducing extra dimensions of horror to the narrative, broadening its scope.By adopting this non-linear approach, the filmmaker constructs a narrative that transcends mere event recounting, evolving into a profound exploration of the human psyche under extreme circumstances. The alternation of perspectives allows the audience to understand not only the events themselves but also the motives and emotional complexities driving the characters' actions.Furthermore, the screenplay cleverly utilizes the technique to create constant suspense, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, eager to discover the next unfolding of this intricate plot. Immersion into the characters' minds, guided by the unconventional narrative, transforms the cinematic experience into an emotionally engaging and intellectually stimulating journey.In summary, Martin Scorsese's unique approach in ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" through the alternation of narrators and breaking of linearity, not only enriches the narrative with emotional depth but also intensifies the complexity of the events portrayed. The courageous exploration of violence and its consequences proves to be a cinematic masterpiece that challenges conventions, leaving an indelible mark on the viewer's mind.Exploring themes of significant historical and social importance, the film reveals remarkable coherence in its narrative, introducing a memorable scene in cinema. In this context, a documentary references the impactful massacre of Tulsa, a dark episode that spanned two days, witnessing the brutality of a crowd of racists against the Black population of an urban district. The result was devastating, with hundreds of fatalities and thousands injured, sadly reflecting historical neglect.As is characteristic of his approach, Martin Scorsese does not hesitate to depict violence in an explicit manner, when necessary for the verisimilitude and impact of the narrative. The brutality inflicted upon the members of the Osage community is presented without filters, revealing the animalistic nature of the perpetrators and the dark depths of the plot. Scorsese's skillful direction not only exposes the physical horrors but also delves into the emotional and social repercussions unleashed by these cruel acts.The filmmaker strategically employs plongée angles, seeking to highlight the vulnerability of the Osage and provide a deeper impact on the viewer. Scorsese, also an admirer of contra plongée angles, makes a notable mistake in a crucial scene: near the end, Ernest, recently arrested and committed to the authorities, is forced to stand before them. This is a slip from the experienced filmmaker, considering that Ernest is in a submissive position, knowing deep down that he will be judged and condemned for his crimes. Thus, it would be more appropriate to employ the plongée angle to highlight the protagonist's situation before the authorities. The choice of contra plongée, while resulting in a beautiful shot, serves to emphasize a situation that does not align with the narrative reality. This is evidence that even an experienced and talented filmmaker like Scorsese is not exempt from making mistakes.Upon concluding the film, Scorsese adds a touch of authenticity by presenting the title initially in Osage language characters. This gesture not only lends tangible authenticity to the narrative but also represents a reverent homage to Osage culture, giving it the deserved spotlight in the cinematic scene and solidifying the importance of this work as a respectful and careful testament to the cultural and spiritual riches of the Osage.Ultimately, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" emerges as a masterpiece of contemporary cinema, transcending the boundaries of entertainment to become a powerful platform for reflection and awareness. Under Martin Scorsese's skillful direction, the narrative unfolds, revealing complex layers of human drama and exploring profound issues of justice, prejudice, and revenge. With stunning cinematography, exceptional performances, and an engaging screenplay, the film captures the essence of the Osage genocide, rescuing the memory of the victims and providing a moving tribute to the resilience of the Osage people.",negative
770,"I really wanted to watch this despite it having subtitles for all the non-English parts, but I tried anyway. I even tried DL'ing 3 different foreign parts only subs.What a waste of time discovering that a shyt load of non-English dialogue have no subs at all. And to make things even worse, the alignment inconsistently drifts around ranging from 3 seconds to over a minute off. This makes it impossible to watch this movie. Don't know who or what group created the foreign parts only subtitles, but what an unbelievably crappy job he, she, or they did. If I had paid money at a theater to watch this with such screwed up subs, I would have walked out and demanded my money back.",negative
771,"Martin scorsese delivers once again with a great piece of cinema, even if it doesn't hit the highs of the past.All around it delivers on a great presentation and performances from all across its cast, but especially Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job at capturing the seemingly dumb-witted nature of his character. The story feels relevant and you can feel craftsmanship behind the filmmaking and writing. That being said the story lacks the ""wow"" moment where you're left in awe, speechless, and mesmerized by the plot or performance of an actor, instead it feels like a well paced drama where you for the most part know the outcome.The editing and cinematography keeps the pace ticking along at a great pace, even with a long run time of 3.5 hours it never truly feels like it could be shortened at any point as every shot is specifically selected and crafted. With the ""fast"" editing and story structure we as viewers are able to keep track of time and evolution of the characters despite it not giving us specific dates. Overall it's an enjoyable movie, but definitely not for everyone. If you like Martin Scorsese's movies, or long drama's this is specifically crafted for you, if not, its completely fine to sit this one out.",negative

Fortunately, I had 3 hours to kill and I am actually very happy about it. The length of the film didn't really bother me because I found the story very interesting and the performances were fantastic. I also didn't find it slow at all. I actually didn't even expect to enjoy it so much but I did, and my probably very unpopular opinion was that this was better than Oppenheimer. I was expecting KOTFM to suck and Opp to blow me away, and somehow beyond my belief they ended up trading places. Very good. 8/10.",negative
773,"There is good stuff in it, but not enough story for it's running time. The story deals with an oil strike with the Osage culture and how many are murdering Indian women in hopes to claim the money. The detective Ernest is investigating and marries one of the women, but they have no chemistry. Deniro plays the Uncle of Ernest (DiCaprio) and isn't interesting either. I knew who the killer would be. There wasn't much energy aside from some good shoot outs and explosions. Scorsese does film some good camera angles and lighting for the flames and point of view shots after or during the riots, but he could've told this story at 2 hours. It was in the middle. Not one of Scorsese's best.",negative
774,"A new Scorsese, always the expectation of a great work. After Irishmen, where Netflix is on it, Netflix is also in it, I was naturally sceptical. But after just half an hour it becomes clear that we have another great film. Classic narrative tempo, epic images, important content, old Hollywood.There are three central roles, all perfectly cast.DiCaprio plays DiCaprio, the required role to the letter. As always, there is nothing to criticise here, in contrast to his private persona. Perhaps the arrogant little creep, someone who is less than he would like to be, a money-grubber and womaniser driven by the simplest of urges, who doesn't really look the part, came relatively easily to him.De Niro is finally back in a role befitting his art, the embodied USA, the embodied evil that has been wreaking havoc for 200 years, first on its ""own"" soil, then all over the world. In the role of the real Robert De Niro, Robert De Niro has for years played the opposite of his typical characters, the supposed clean man, a Democrat prototype. So let's stick to the big screen at this point too.Last but not least, of course, Lily Gladstone, a fantastic performance. A face that reflects the suffering and pain of the ethnic group portrayed with moving intensity.Contrary to what many people say, I don't think Killers Of The Flower Moon is too long. Three and a half hours of shock for any viewer with just a little heart and morals. This historical tragedy doesn't deserve a second less. The diabolical wickedness shown here is almost unbelievable, especially knowing that it is based on true events.",negative

Was worth the 3 and a half hours of my time!I'm my honest opinion I think it should have a higher rating than it currently has. Based on the real facts, it seems to be fairly accurate which makes it feel more real. It was something that I was very keen on getting to know more about, especially learning about the Osage culture and this film definitely pulled it off for me. It was actually quite refreshing and different also. I get sick of watching the same type of films all of the time.",negative

She was like Mona Lissa!On the other hand, the movie felt flat. Its length was the main reason that it just lost its momentum and its emotional impact. It actually ended up being more about the courtroom story, than the actual case. That ending was also anticlimatic and not the best choice.",negative
777,"All these reviewers saying this film is a masterpiece and brutally honest... What's wrong with you? Just because Martin Scorsese is a famous director people think everything he makes must be amazing... People are afraid to put their heads above the parapet and go against the grain and question a big name like Scorsese. You cowards! This film is terrible. It doesn't know if it's a comedy or a drama or what. The acting is over the top and the story idea is something we've all seen a dozen times before. I read a review where someone mentioned that a film from the 1950s told this story exactly! Come on! Sadly people think because Scorsese is Scorsese everything he does must be solid gold. This is not solid gold. This is rusting bronze. Yes the cinematography is nice and the score and some of the lesser roles are played nicely. It doesn't matter because the main stars Leonardo DeCaprio, Robert DeNiro and Lily Gladstone are like wood! Stop being afraid to question and criticise bad movies because they come from famous directors or feature famous actors. This is a bad movie and that's all there is to it.",negative
778,"I do not deny that Martin Scorsese is a master craftsman and even more so there is no denying his absolute adoration of film which is admirable. Having said all of that, I have a serious problem with his more recent films and they are all due to length. None of his recent films have needed to be three to 3 1/2 hours long and that includes this one. Length aside this is a very well made movie which comes as no surprise. It tells an important story that has an inevitable outcome which makes its length even more unnecessary. Also making the length of his movies irritating is that they are almost always about mostly unpleasant people doing unpleasant things and I don't need three and a half hours of that. This very interesting story, that would have been much more compelling if it had been tighter, of the awfulness of white men killing and stealing from Indians is a not very new downer, but what else would it be?! The cast mostly does a good job. Of the principal cast I was most impressed by Robert De Niro really on his game here. Lily Gladstone is very touching in a long suffering role with little dialog, but I had mixed feelings about Leonardo di Caprio. There are times when it seems like he's about to go into a Sling Blade invitation. It's photographed and scored very well and it's a superior piece of filmmaking that damages itself due to Scorsese' inability to condense storylines. The most impressive moment of this film for me was the very ending which I thought was very clever and Scorsese making an appearance himself I found rather moving.",negative
779,"Cinema. The best film of 2023 after Oppenheimer and Marty's best since the Wolf. Such an important story. This year, stories win. Despite its length, the script grabs you right from the beginning. I felt the human and territorial theft and the overwhelming sense of inhumanity and brutality on my skin. De Niro's performance helps to give that tone to the film. There are no rushes, no important changes of rhythm, yet the film flows brilliantly keeping you attached to the screen and not lacking twists and surprises.I think the characters are the heart of the story. Given its length, I'd have concentrated more on them. Mollie. The Osage. Since the film it's about them. But the overall sense that the film wanted to convey and present to the world is there. And it's strong. Tough competition this year. And Leo is not nominated because every time he acts he's on another level. Rare level of dedication I see from no one else. As long as Marty keeps doing this, cinema isn't going anywhere.",negative
780,"I see Martin Scorsese as one of the greatest of our time. It's a quality stamp in itself when he's on the job. This one however, feels like it shouldn't have made it to production.The performances of everyone, is spot on as you'd expect. The music is also great - hell, it's a good movie when you think about it. It's just about 2 hours too long. It's certainly not Martin Scorsese's longest film but it feel like it. I'm all for an all nighter, but there's just not enough of an interesting story here. It doesn't help that the story only have bad guys in it - not a single likeable character in the movie.The Irishman and The Departed are in my top 10 movies and I've watched them many times. This one I will never want to watch again.",negative
781,"I had to write a review after reading so many negatives. It seems some of the watchers here can't apprieiciate the real art of storytelling.Im a empath, which I guess is why it's left me feeling like I do. As a white western male, I'm once again questioning actions of race as I have done repeatably with age. This film has me thinking; if I was alive and in this time, maybe I would be just like them because I haven't learnt the history I know and developed the empathy I have.It's been a longtime for me to watch a movie that made me feel this way, sat afterwards pondering in my thoughts. Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of my lifetime and for me, this is up there with the rest.If your open to broader subjects, deeper thinking and enjoy the art of storytelling. This is absolutely for you.",negative
782,"I love Martin Scorsese and have enjoyed his many outstanding films! I also love actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert de Niro and others that starred in this film. I'm impressed that all those that I mentioned continue to work and try to refine their art and aren't content with just being great at what they have already done! Nonetheless, while the subject matter was very interesting and I learned a lot I would have liked to have seen more from native Americans in leading roles. This film reminded me of Mississippi Burning where the subject matter is about the exploitation of a segment of our population but told from the lens of the white experience. I'm still happy that the film was made but I wish that more evolution will take place in Hollywood regarding the native American story. I also feel that Leo was snubbed by the Oscar committee! Thank you Martin Scorsese for continuing to make movies even though you don't have to!",negative
783,"Martin Scorsese's epic film about the systematic murders of the Osage people that happened in Osage County, Oklahoma between the 1910s and 1930s, is now streaming on AppleTV+. The film stars now Golden Globe winner and soon to be Oscar nominee Lily Gladstone alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, but it doesn't stop there. Jesse Plemons, Tantoo Cardinal, John Lithgow, and even Brendan Fraser rounds out this truly stellar cast. As you can imagine with a cast like this, and a legendary director such as Scorsese behind the camera, there are truly some magnificent performances in this film with Gladstone and De Niro stealing the show.As is my habit (probably a bad one), once I find out that a film is based on a true story, I instantly take to the internet to find out how historically accurate the film is. I am happy to report that Killers of the Flower Moon stays historically accurate to the true story that it is based upon. This may be one of the things that I enjoyed most about this film because a story like this needs to be told and told correctly.My only critique of the film is that 3 hours and 26 minutes is too long of a movie. I have always believed that a story can be effectively told in under 3 hours. Of course, I would have been naive if I did not think that a DiCaprio movie, especially one directed by Scorsese, would be anything if not well over 3 hours long. All that being said I believe that it is well worth the time to see this.Thank you and enjoy!",negative
784,"After reading the book, I had great hopes for this movie. I'm thinking something along the lines of the timeless Godfather series. However, I was very disappointed and it mostly has to do with the actors cast in various roles. William Hale was in his 50s and De Niro is 80. It was very difficult to project the role of a money grubbing murderer in his eighties. And Ernest Burkhart, just home from WW I, was in his 20s not pushing 50 like Decaprio. And Tom White was a big man older than Burkhart, yet he was played by Jesse Plemons who is 10 years younger than DiCaprio. Plemons calling Decaprio ""boy"" was just plain laughable. The best actors in the movie were mostly unknowns and they played their roles well. Martin Scorsese has lost his way. Too bad, great book.",negative
785,"Pretty good movie from Scorcese. Much better than the Irishman. Even though it's over 200 min long, you don't feel the runtime. Interesting and engaging throughout. First Scorcese movie I've seen that has a mystery element. Great performances from De Niro, DiCaprio and the lead actress. No movie before this has really shown the plight and brutality against the Native Americans but this one does. Also interesting that this one shows the beginning of the FBI. Reminds me of The Goodfellas at times...(you might understand what I mean by this after you see the movie). Definitely watch if you're a Scorcese fan or just a cinema lover in general. Have a good time!",negative
786,"With legendary director Scorsese, top notch cast, and very interesting underlying true story there seemed to be a lot of hype about this film. It seemed like a must-see, and it is worth a look-see. However, I was expecting more. It's quite long, 3 1/2 hours! And really a story that could have been told with an hour less time. It dragged on, particularly in the last hour. Maybe too many conversation scenes between Ernest and Mollie. Some good history to know from this film. I am glad that it's been brought to light, by the book as well which this film is based on. Check it out, but have an extra large popcorn and coke.",negative
787,"This movie has the distinction of being one of two that I've walked out on. Slow moving, disjointed, disappointing. We decided not to stick it out for the duration.After 2.5 hours into the movie and no end in sight, we decided to walk out. There were no conclusions, only suspicions. Which may be how it played out, but it didn't justify our staying.Good cast, poor story. It was a waste of money. The book may be more interesting.I hoped the cast was evidence of it's quality and story but it wasn't enough for us.Boring. Jumping around. It doesn't say the year it started. You would think a movie based on history would say ""1921"" or something. What little text there was during the movie (translation from the Osage language and historical commentary) was difficult to read as it was on the screen for too short a period of time (and I'm a fast reader).",negative
788,"Apparently Martin Scorsese is doggedly determined to ramp up the running times of each successive movie. Killers of the Flower Moon would have probably worked a lot better as a NetFlix or HBO mini series than a full-length feature movie, but most likely DiCaprio and DeNiro could not commit to filming a lengthy mini series. That said, the film is worth a binge, ideally watching the entire movie versus breaking it up as so many people are doing now that the movie is streaming.I never read the book but understand that many details in the book were not covered in this 3 1/2 hour epic, another reason why the mini series approach may have been better. I think about Scorsese's involvement with the excellent HBO mini series Boardwalk Empire (he directed the show's pilot); had bigger stars been involved with the mini series, most likely Boardwalk Empire, which spanned 5 seasons, would have been reduced to a long movie as well.That all said, the movie is excellent, a real slow burner, and I enjoyed it more than 2023's other 3-hour period piece, Oppenheimer. DiCaprio was passed over in the Best Actor category because he really doesn't cover new ground here - his character is a bit dimwitted but a survivor, and has echoes of his character from Gangs of New York. DeNiro, who did get an Oscar nomination, is reunited with his This Boy's Life co-star as the mysterious uncle ""King"" Hale, who eggs on DiCaprio, playing Ernest Buckhart, a World War I veteran, early in the movie to court the young Osage woman Ernest is driving around in his ""taxi."" By doing this courting, Hale explains, and eventually marrying the Osage woman Mollie, Hale, Buckhart, and their families will become millionaires inheriting the oil fields Mollie's family's land sits on.This is all done at an extremely leisurely pace. In this era of low attention spans and hyper-edited CGI comic book movies, audiences will either walk out or shut the movie off after 30 minutes. The rest of us who watch the film all the way through will be rewarded with beautiful cinematography, period detail, and fine performances, particularly by Lily Gladstone as Mollie. Other familiar faces show up as well (John Lithgow, Jesse Plemons, Brendan Fraser).One thing a mini series probably would have done is delve into the Mason background of King Hale. In the movie, there is an interesting scene involving King, Ernest, and an apparent Mason ritual. The Mason movement, a forerunner in a way to later quasi-religious and political movements, had a bit of a revival in the prosperous 1920s, attracting wealthy industrialists looking for a private sanctuary to protect their deeds (and their wealth).In the end, the film is thought-provoking and pure cinema. And after becoming accustomed to the pace of the film, the 3 1/2 hours go by very quickly.",negative
789,"At a minimum, this is a visually gorgeous film, rich in period detail. If you are able to sit for 3Â½ hours, by all means do see it that way. That includes the broad assortment of 1920s cars. I complain often about wrong cars in films. If anything, these highly authentic ones are a bit too well kept up. Cars got old and shabby rapidly in those days. But--apparently the sound designers did not get the memo. That day's rich palette of transportation sounds is all but ignored. Model Ts and Chevys are shown silently gliding along like Teslas. To carry on a conversation while underway in that pre-WWI Model T, Molly and Ernest would at least have had to raise their voices. By the way, Mr. Scorsese, thank you for calling out those wonderful Pierce-Arrows. Those were really something!",negative
790,"It is a powerful true story and yet after all the murders and mystery really not edited and quite sloppy in places and maybe would be far better with an actor other than leanardo. It is worth just sticking with this move as Robert de-nero was really good in his role and after half an hour it picks up.Martin scorseses schindler's list both him and spielberg have achieve so much and yet the both can take you on journeys that you never expect.It just needed something, maybe better music or editing to give it life. Martins last film that was just pure joy to watch was for me departed a different subject ,but so well edited and story was gripping from start to finnish. This movie was just lacking and not the oscar winning performance or movie of this year.",negative
791,"This qas surprisingly fantastic, but when you're watching a Martin Scorececi's expect it to be a Masterpiece of art and with the listed casts I know I was in for a qild ride.This movie will have you on the edge of your Chair from the moment it starts, a combination of everything, including the cold comedy that'll have you laughing but concerned about what's gonna happened next.Leo, Bobby my word, and to Lily Gladstone, darling welcome to Superstardom, because of this film I will be closely watching your work moving forth, amazing.And finally to Mr. Martin Scorecesi, you have never fail to amaze me on the way you bring a plot to life. This film here will definitely be in your top 5 of my collections sir and respect to all the Co-directors and writers who've also worked on this magnificent project, thank you, thank you and respect to all my native tribes all over North America, one love.",negative
792,"Tldr;
Good movie if you're ok with the length. Love story strong enough to keep mixed-sex audience emotionally involved during watching. It gets too focused on one aspect (that isn't the love part) around the middle which can leave a great share of people a bit bored for something that felt to me like 20 minutes. Emotionally powerful ending makes up for it.Actually the tldr was all I wanted to write about the movie itself. I just have a little disclaimer. Movies based on, and naming real events/places/people in my opinion deserve lower ratings proportionally to the weight and presence of the matter(s) in question. Why? A great documentary paints a full picture, sticking to what's considered to be facts, disregarding the need for relatable characters, involving dialogue, emotional charge and so on. Story movies have to make things up, many times they knowingly mix it up to make themselves watchable and/or more interesting. That causes all sorts of issues with people watching them. To be clear it's not a rant on this movie specifically.",negative
793,"It's not that I didn't like it but best be sure that I am not gonna see this any time soon. Its rewatchability is very limited because of its runtime. And it's not like it has many storylines so it tackles a bunch of characters. Just one and done. I can justify the runtime but at the same time you have to pay me to do so. Scorsese can make a 5 hour movie and we will all watch it, I am sure.I had the same feeling that I had after The Irishman. It is a great movie for the moment, while watching it, but did I see that again? No. Don't get me wrong, this is a very detailed story and the cast is all great - white man is the devil, emairight? The production design, make-up and costumes are also masterclass.Another flaw I would say are the characters, pretty much one note from start to finish. Just Ernest I would say has a semi-arc but he is just a antagonist so he left a sour taste in my mouth. I wish he was more than a manipulated fool. I kinda wished he wised up at some point.There is a bunch to say and other have said it better than me. It's Scorsese, so of course I am gonna watch his movie. His cameo was touching.",negative
794,"I just hate the fact that they just give you the plot of the whole movie in the first 15 minutes and then you have to watch 3 more hours of what you already know.Lilly Gladstone just giver the best performance and makes even leo dicaprio looking like a amateur actor.But it feels they don't know what to do with Mollie character, sometimes she feels so smart and then sometimes she feels so naive and it feels like the script doesn't give her the credit that she is, if wasn't for lilly Gladstone outstanding acting, her character would look very flat and stupid, and even that leo dicaprio looks like a side character in his own movie.",negative
795,"I was really looking forward to Killers of the Flower Moon, given that it's directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro probably for the last time. However, I came away from the film feeling a bit disappointed.De Niro's performance as William Hale was the highlight of the film for me. He was truly menacing and convincing as the ruthless businessman who is suspected of orchestrating the murders. His first scene, where he tells Di Caprio to call him ""King Hale"", lays the foundation for his charismatic performance. He should be considered for an Oscar for this portray. Unpopular opinion, his ""death stare"" in this movie was even more menacing than his Goodfellas one ðŸ˜„ Gave me the chills.However, I found DiCaprio's role to be underdeveloped. His character was all over the place and wasn't as interesting as Hale (De Niro), and his motivations and state of mind were missing almost the whole movie. Nothing like his brilliant role in The Departed for instance.The film was also too long and slow-paced. There were several scenes that could have been cut without affecting the story. I was ready for a long movie, but the story of Killers of the flower moon was unnecessarily stretched. This could have been a great movie if it was 2 hours and 20 or 30 minutes.And finally, the film lacked a sense of mystery. We know who the killers are from the start, so there is no suspense in trying to figure out who committed the murders. It's presented more like a documentary and less like a true crime movie.Overall, I think Killers of the Flower Moon is a well-made film with strong performances, especially from De Niro. However, it is too long and slow-paced, and it lacks a sense of mystery. Also, there is no moral at the end of the story, it just ends because the murders were solved. DiCaprio's character was confusing to me even after the final scene... he just does things throughout the movie and no logic or understanding of the character's state of mind were presented to the audience. Was he sorry for what he had done, wasn't he, did he love his wife and kids or was it all just a scheme, was he remorseful, was he just a cold-blooded killer, was he a patsy... you just don't receive these answers at the end of the movie and DiCaprio's performance additionally confuses the audience. He overdelivered some scenes and in others he was just nervous, then he didn't care, than he cared a bit, than he overdelivered again... really all over the place. Maybe not the greatest part for him in this movie.I expected more, but still a good movie, just not the classic i was expecting from Scorsese/De Niro/DiCaprio and this interesting story at firat glance.",negative
796,"The 2023 film, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", was directed and produced by Martin Scorsese with Leanardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro in the major roles. The movie is based on the best-selling 2007 book by David Grann (described as a ""workhouse journalist""). It runs for 3 hours and 26 minutes. IMDB rated this at 8.6 the day it was released; at the time of this writing, the rating is 8.2. I liken the buildup for this movie to that of the George Lucas' original Star Wars movie in 1977. One reviewer said, ""It changed our world forever. I doubt that ! Flower Moon, however, may pique the viewer's interest with a true story of our American experience, similar to the ""buried accounts"" of the encampment of Japanese citizens during Worl War II.Wikipedia describes this as an ""epic revisionist Western crime drama"" - the traditional format and themes of the western are subverted by such devices as the Native American protagonist, strong female characters; the outlaw protagonist, plots that are pre-eminently concerned with survival in a wild environment or the presentation of a morally ambiguous storyline without definite heroes,
This seems pretty accurate. On a personal level, having read (and reread) Davin Grann's book and read about his research into the occurrences in Oklahoma, I was most interested in the proper telling of the story. I give this aspect of the film an 8 out of 10. There should have been more explanation of the sizeable amount of money involved. Carnegie, Rockefeller and others were all biding for oil rights, 40 room houses, 1918 Mercedes Benzes with white men chauffeuring Osage landowners. Implausible theatrics allowing DiCaprio and De Niro to talk in adjacent jail cells. Texas Ranger, Tom White, and his role were not depicted as I understood from THE BOOK. According to Grann, he was on his own during most of the investigation (not backed by agents with shotguns in the film) and was a bit more ruthless than the mild mannered part played by Jesse Plemons. The struggles of the newly formed FBI under J. Edgar Hoover should have been included as germane to the story. (Come on . . . It's part of Grann's book title)
The film did a fine job creating the chaotic, entrepreneurial and expoitive atmosphere of the oil boom in the west. Great old cars, historically correct desolate surroundings.Overall, the acting was superb. De Niro was his usual hypocritical ""old boy"" self. Very believable in the role of ""King"" William Hele. You started to hate him in his first scene. DiCaprio surprised me, showing to be a very complex man; at times the viewer is not sure of his allegiance. His facial expressions and demeanor were so much in character that he often didn't even look like DiCaprio. Lily Gladstone wins my award as the best actor in this movie. Her suffering, softness, simple wisdom and strength were so real. My favorite scene was toward the end when she asked Ernest Burkhard (DiCaprio) if he'd told the whole truth.. Then asked him what was in her medicine. Upon his response, she walked out without a word.I took extensive notes the first time I read the book because I had trouble keeping the people and the chronology straight. I found the movie a bit hard to follow, also. It jumped around in places making it difficult for the viewer to fit pieces together. The story could have been told in much less than 3 Â½ hours. The ending with the orchestra and narrator seemed out of place, although interesting.Lastly, I believe that the credibility of this true story would have been enhanced by a prologue or by Credits at the end. A few notes about David Grann living in Oklahoma for 2 years, interviewing grandchildren of Osage tribe members from th 1920's and pouring through county records stored in boxes on 2nd floor lofts in abandoned airplane hangars. (Prologue would be best since no one stays for the credits in theaters anymore)
Throughout, there were times when I squeezed my wife's hand and gasped in disgust, surprise and sympathy. The movie definitely had an emotional impact. I doubt, however, that this film will withstand the test of time to be watched by future generations. Overall: 7/10 R. Jones, October 2023.",negative
797,"Please understand - I anticipated watching this movie for quite some time and was convinced I was going to enjoy it. In the seemingly endless stream of crap that gets churned out by Hollywood these days, I was certain this would be special. Knowing its length I opted to wait to watch at home, and thank god I did.This film is a dud right from the start and never builds any momentum, tension or payoff. One long winded sigh of a movie. Didn't even know it was possible, or how Marty pulled it off, but this is the first movie I've ever seen where an hour in, you could take an hour nap, wake up well rested, resume the movie, not have missed a single thing, and still completely understand what is going on. THATS the most impressive part of this film.Lacking in any real character development, no shades to anybody. No relatable character through which to enter the story. It certainly doesn't help when our main character is borderline mentally disabled and has no other action to play other than scowling or confused. Furthermore, it's hard to buy into why our main female protagonist even likes DiCaprio, let alone loves him or trusts him. It makes no sense. No tension, no mystery, no excitement. Every half hour, a character we barely know, maybe haven't even met, gets shot in the head - so I guess there's that. Yet every death lacks any emotional punch.Within the first ten minutes it's painfully obvious where the story is going, who the good and bad guys are. A film about the mystery of what is happening to this tribe lacks any mystery or shock or surprise. That's a failure as far as I'm concerned.Making an audience sit through nearly four hours and then ending it with THAT ending. Oh jesus. By the end, you wonder if this entire project was an experiment to see how long one can torture the viewer.Skip this one. You're not missing much.",negative
798,"Scorsese, DiCaprio and De Niro you've sold me already! I don't need to know anything about the film and I'll watch it. Arguably three of the most talented and legendary people within the film industry, collaborating once again!Straight to the point! This film is great and yet another example of Scorsese not slowing down with age. An Absolute brutal film that is gorgeous to see yet horrifying to watch at the same time. The story is both beautiful yet heartbreaking and haunting. I'm not sure what else you could add to this film to make it better because I think Mr Scorsese has squeezed every single bit out of the story he could.For me though in an odd twist its not DiCaprio or Scorsese or Gladstone who is the big standout for me. That goes to Robert De Niro, who is truly magnificent in this film. Cunning, sly and yet oddly charming his character and performance embody the absolute core essence of evil. Yet in his own mind his thinks he is doing a great service to people and the community, again tapping into his narcissism. I haven't seen De Niro on the this level for a while and I'm so surprised it hasn't been mentioned more. I think without his performance the film wouldn't have the tension, anticipation or threat that it has.Now onto the negatives! The reason why this review is so far after the release of the film was due to one reason. I was put off by the runtime! Sitting in a theatre for that long about a very dark and complex topic, even with the touch of legends didn't sway me to see it. I am so glad I waited for this to be available on streaming. This film is way way way to long for its own good. I'd say easily 30-40 minutes could be cut and maybe benefit the pacing. I knew going in the film was obviously gonna be slow however I didn't realise how much of a slog it would really be.Another strange negative I have is re-watchability. Most of Scorsese's back catalog of films are extremely re-watchable. That is of course what makes his work so great and iconic. However I don't see myself jumping at the chance to watch the again. I can appreciate its artistry and great story telling however it hasn't got me wanting more or repeat viewings. Maybe due to the topic of the film but I feel more due to the runtime and pacing which is rough.Never the less its a great film and just mastery across the board! 80% out of 100!",negative
799,"I enjoy a good period piece on historical biopic involving atrocities and this is definitely a period piece and it's definitely a biopic about atrocities but I can't necessarily say it's good but it's not bad either, merely middling.This wouldn't have been better as a miniseries. I feel the egos of those involved prevented this from being delivered in an appropriate medium which carries a certain amount of irony given the topic.At three and half hours, it is simply too long. Few movies have enough action and suspense to carry a viewer through that much length, this isn't one of them. If this had been given a miniseries treatment it could have carried more punch between the various reveals.The way the movie unfolds is clearly four acts. The first act is confusing. If this was meant to be mysterious or suspenseful, it failed. The second act reveals details that were obscured from the viewer but there is little satisfaction in this, the payoff isn't there. The third quarter contains further reveals details at a more satisfying depth as an a proper investigation occurs, this is where things finally start to get interesting, but it takes two hours to get there. The fourth quarter stands alone as justice slowly plays out with its own twists and turns. Broken out into four or eight parts would have made this easier to digest.",negative
800,"I really really liked this movie, it was very interesting and had a lot of action. At the beginning of the movie it shows how Ernest and Mollie fall in love but in reality all Ernest wanted was her money because he knew that they were very wealthy. Ernest had an uncle and they made a plan to kill all of the Indians one by one but they were very secretive about it. What I did not like about the movie is that Ernest went behind his wife's back and even tried to help her and everything with the murders even though he was behind it all. Everyone in Molly's family had an illness and were going to die. Mollie was very sick with diabetes and gets very close to dying but i don't know why it took her so long to realize that her husband only wanted her money, which is really messed up. But overall i really liked it and i'm glad his wife got better and everything.",negative
801,"The movie ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a multi-genre plot, encompassing elements of romance, drama, mystery, history, and crime. It's set in the 1920s and revolves around a series of murders within the Osage Nation following the discovery of oil on their land. Director Martin Scorsese brings an indigenous story to the screen, a story forgotten in American history and filled with greed, corruption, and injustice. Scorsese is back and persists in employing the same techniques seen in his earlier movies. He repeatedly uses flashback scenes, seemingly to ensure that the audience has grasped the script.Indeed, the screenplay is the movie's weak point. At times, it resembles a dialogue between teenagers, rendering numerous segments of the movie unconvincing, feeble, and lacking in meaning. Also, actress Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart, fails to convince. It appears as though she's been sedated from the beginning of the movie.Overall, it mirrors other Scorsese gangster films, but with a twist. The struggle for supremacy now involves the native Osage Indians, who fall victim to White gangs in the pursuit of oil.",negative
802,"Killers of the Flower Moon does a great job telling this real life story. The world building was excellent and the Osage people were done justice here. They felt like real people and their culture was explored in a grand way. A lot of this has to do with Martin Scorsese's incredible directing and out of this world cinematography. The costumes were also very good and pretty accurate to what they were based on. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro both give amazing performances, as we've come to expect from them and Lily Gladstone shines in her first major role. I think the story was solid however I wasn't crazy how it ended with a story recap of what happened. It felt a little random. The music and sound was good throughout. The movie utilized its very long runtime well for the most part however it definitely could have been cut down a little bit without losing anything that important. Overall this movie succeeded with what it was going for and did with with some style. 8/10.",negative
803,"The story is powerful as is the acting in most cases, but the pace was slow and made the film feel dragged out at times. I also think they could have used subtitles more judiciously on scenes where Ernest talks to his wife in Osage language. Nevertheless, import history to document, even though this account is surely fictionalized to a great degree. I felt DeNiro was underutilized and underplayed his role to some degree. That was also a weakness. Not a big fan of DiCaprio, but this is probably the best actual performance I've seen from him in a while. He's usually basically playing himself or a caricature thereof. This was an actual character with his accent and bearing adjusted well. The Indian actors were amazing. The sets and settings felt authentic but there were definitely some scenes that could have been shortened or shortcutted around to make the film shorter and better paced.",negative
804,"Scorched by greed and stained by betrayal, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" unfurls a chilling true story on the oil-drenched plains of Oklahoma. DiCaprio commands the screen as a half-Osage detective grappling with loyalty and justice, while De Niro chills as a ruthless rancher harboring dark secrets. Scorsese's masterful lens captures the stark beauty and lurking shadows of the frontier, weaving a suspenseful tapestry of corruption and consequence. Though pacing falters in the midst of its sprawling narrative, the film explodes with powerful performances and searing social commentary. A haunting ballad of greed, justice, and the enduring stain of America's original sin.",negative
805,"A gripping tale, that accurately and eloquently showcases the hardship of the American Osage tribe. DiCaprio and De Niro, never lose your attention through a strong duo performance. However, the inevitable end of this historic drama, never really creates the suspense that you are hoping to witness. A simply straight forward presentation of characters, engages you due to the realness of human simplicity shown, make for a strong case that this is worth the three and a half show. However, quite frankly, this is a drama best suited for the home cinema. Not just due to the lack of cinematic shots, that usually would make a cinema trip worthwhile. The entire film is undervalued, by the lack of depth and visual appeal, that would help create a more engaging experience for the viewer.An accurate depiction of history is needed, to represent victims of past atrocities. Yet a film can only engage the viewer if it represents these cases in a driven filming sequence. Unfortunately flower moon is better compared to a tv drama, than a cinematic showpiece.",negative
806,"Should have been 1.5 hours. Instead its full of scenes that have no meaning. The same trope of ""marry, kill, inherit"" is repeated like 5 times.DiCaprio's character and every villain in the movie are stupid. They don't see the obvious lead ons.There's scenes where you don't understand what's talked and there are no subtitles.There's scenes of a random guy dancing, never to be seen again.I have no idea why this movie is praised and why it has a rating of 8 at the time of this writing.If you go to this movie you can safely skip the first hour and a half, you won't miss anything.Bah. Utterly disappointing.",negative
807,"Pretty safe to say this will have awards season all over it. Deservedly so, I would say, although I do have to make a concession to those who felt the picture was too long at three and a half hours. When I looked up the historical back story of this film and its characters, I was surprised to learn that the people and events in it happened pretty much as represented on screen. The villain of the piece is portrayed by Robert De Niro, whose William 'King' Hale displays one of the most duplicitous characters you'll ever witness in a movie. Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, but when he outlines his vicious plans to nephew Ernest Buckhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), you realize what a despicable human being he is. The story involves the deceit employed by Hale and his nephews to murder members of an Osage Indian family in order to secure what are called the headrights to their oil fortune discovered in the Indian territory of Oklahoma during the early 1920's. The intriguing part of the story concerns how Ernest Buckhart, who appears to sincerely love his Osage wife Mollie (Lily Gladstone), takes part in a gradual effort to do away with members of her own family without her knowledge. Missteps and outright incompetence leave a trail for a Bureau of Investigation agent (Jesse Plemons) to follow up on, that eventually leads to the arrest of both Ernest and his uncle. Actress Lily Gladstone is being hailed in her role as Mollie Burkhart, as her performance over the course of the story involves a rare range of emotion in dealing with the deaths of her mother and sisters, while gradually being poisoned with doctor provided poison administered by her husband as part of an insulin regimen. The conflicting nature of DiCaprio's character causes real puzzlement on the part of the viewer, so that you never quite know if he's willingly poisoning his wife. With a large cast of supporting players, this is an expansive film examining a brutal chapter in the country's history, and a worthy addition to the list of director Martin Scorcese's best movies.",negative
808,"This movie is sad, beautiful, tragic and captivating. I'm a Scorsese fan and when I heard about this movie I thought about the book first. I was so curious how he is going to make this into a movie. He did it perfectly! The cast is genius and this story needs to be told and seen to understand the terrible things that have happened. I was sitting in the cinema and had so many emotions during. The Osage nation has such a beautiful culture, I love that all Native Americans have such a close connection to nature. Leo deserves an Oscar for this. Robert De Niro was such a believable villain. I definitely recommend and I will watch it again for sure.",negative
809,Quite the long run time but the viewer may not even notice with how great the pacing is. The performances given by the main cast is absolutely captivating the whole way through. With each progression of the story you're hooked in wanting to see more and feel more. Even if the feelings are of anger and disgust at the actions of the character you can't help but wonder and hope it will change by the end. While majority of this movie is already an emotional ride the last 10 -15 minutes takes a turn. The conclusion of the story and its events changes style and format and to me i felt cheated out of a resolution. Instead of being involved in the last moments of the characters and their story we simply hear about them. To me after watching and being with the characters for so long through the course of the movie I felt disappointed as though something I deserved was taken from me. After a long enough time to think about the movie I had to ask myself if this is why that scene was there. Was I suppose to feel this way like that of the characters or am I putting to much thought to it? Worth the watch so you to can ask yourself the same.,negative
810,"Killers of The Flower Moon is a movie directed by Martin Scorsese, with the absolutely epic trio, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone, and all of them delivered an amazing performance with feeling, emotions and engagement. The plot is taking us back to a long time ago, when white Americans buyed land from the Natives, and all of the side effect that came after. The story was holding in almost the whole of the movie, including some romance between the characters and the introduction to the traditions of The Natives. Have you had that feeling that your eyes was sticked to the screen, and you where so focused on what was going on? I got that feeling many, many times across the movie, and sometimes it was just normal. Everything was somehow nice to watch on the screen. The amazing pictures and all of the old-time scenography with no mistakes, it did really look like if this was some 1930s. The characters were great, rememberable, with a great character development. Lily Gladstone as the lost, sick native that has lost so much, did deliver so much rage, and so much emotion, that was incredible, and also a bit terrifying to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio as Ernest, the native's husband, did play a badass, but at the same time manipulated man by his uncle, and you know, everything was stuck on the right place. The plot was good, and it got action, even if it isn't maybe the action you think it is. It isn't explosions, epic gun fights or karate, but here it is more of a action holding with important conversations and talk scenes, with the great, suspenseful music that made me wonder, what's coming next. The genres they are talking about is very important, about the rights of the different once's, and that it is important to fight for something that it is worth fighting for. I really enjoyed my time at the theatre, but it could have been at least fifteen minutes shorter. If it was, maybe a full-star rating could be possible.",negative
811,"I was interested in the story. A story I knew nothing about, I love Scorsese, de Niro, Di Caprio, Plesse and the whole entourage. WIN, WIN, or at least so I thought. The actors, known and unknown were great. The atmosphere and cinematography super. But, Dear God, why oh why did they have to drag this out like this. I read the Times article of the murders and it was riveting. This dreadful case and evil greedy murderers and the fall out could have been a pacey thriller. I realise that it sounds like I am trivialising such an event and I don't mean to. I've asked my hubby to put something lighthearted on. That's an afternoon I will never get back and it's just a grim, long dragged out film.",negative
812,Ignore the reviews that complain about overacting and length. These reviewers don't understand character development and the pacing that is involved because of it.The direction is stellar and the sparse use of music and score add to the drama. It doesn't give the audience an escape.Some may find the lack of comeuppance disarming as it doesn't resolve the conflict but I feel that's the point. There was never really a coda to the story which makes this all the more brutal. You can tell Scorese put a lot of thought and emotion into this.It's really unclear what DiCaprio's true motives are for his character. I particularly enjoyed the radio play at the end as an interesting choice to lighten the load. There could have been more to the epilogue. 10 out of 10 for sure. Go see it!,negative
813,"Oh boy its production design and edit gave me goosebumps. It's the directors trademark. But that's about it....Why are big names as Rockefeller and the American political elnvironment left out of this historical narrative? If you want to make a strong statement about white guild you better not end up with a local family doing dirty stuff to Indians. That's not portraying the real mechanism of early 20s century american oil-industry and all the monstrosities resulting from it (Big Pharma etc)Why keeping on moaning about indians if your nation is still full trottle on modern post-colonialism all over the planet in all kind of forms? Better adress th√§t instead of indians, who already evolved into American life and will sadly never return to their plains and sacred rituals again.The soul of this movie is neo-christian self-punishment, almost as an excuse to justify present-day colonialism.This movie is not shocking and really investigating behind the coulisse of history. This is a 'neat' product, like the performances of the main characters are.Martin, dare being a rebel again.",negative
814,"Watched it in an IMAX theatre yesterday - good screen size for the large, slow and intense movie.Martin Scorcese is already a legend, and has pushed his legendariness a few more notches with this amazing heart wrenching tale.Lily Gladstone - shines brighter than the one and only Leonardo Di Caprio. Granted, Leo has been roughed up and toned down. Even then, the ease with which Lily steals the limelight is impressive. Irrespective of where she is placed in the screen, how many people are there with her, whether she is with De Niro or Di Caprio, she just draws you in. The kind of woman who can absorb all the badness around into her peace. As the movie would reveal, her charms were challenged by the viciousness around.It is not just her presence. Her acting has been just as astounding.Leonardo Di Caprio kept for himself the most challenging male character. He has performed extremely well - beating any of his earlier performances. Leo's performance has been top notch, dramatic performances that reminds you of ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"".Robert De Niro must definitely have felt left out due to his age. He hardly has as much scope for performance. He brings out his protagonist's look and character to a fault.Scorcese continues to stay with crime as the subject of his movies. This was a much bigger undertaking even then - slowly burning in the shocking vice that was done in american history. Art, grandeur, perfection, performances everything blends in to make a wondrous movie.Deeply disturbing. I can still feel the pain and the angst that the movie left me with. The slow pace that the movie took and how it snowballed into such a massive force is Scorcese's mastery. I had noticed that there are very detailed shots that by themselves represent a narrative that could have been expressed with a set of shots. I think that is how the movie while it feels slow also intensifies at the same time.",negative
815,"Definitely not ""Goodfellows"" nor ""The Irishman."" Maybe not equal to ""Silence"". No zing, lacked emotion. The good thing about it was that it didn't seem to be a three hour plus movie. Give it credit, and that you told the story and got through the story.A moviegoer expects De Niro and DiCaprio, to be good, to always be at the top of their game. I don't think either was exceptionally over the top of your game. In fact, the opening scenes with DiCaprio showed his face to have a rather contrived expression. That expression completely faded during the rest of the movie, thus suggesting it was a little bit of a fake.Speaking of contrived, the ending was a complete surprise, a complete add-on that really didn't make any sense. Could've been handled much differently. Quite possibly, like a documentary.Overall, I predict a disastrous financial return for this movie.",negative
816,"The pacing of ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" felt slow, certain scenes were confusing, and some characters displayed lies and greed. Unfortunately, the movie lacked the emotional impact I was hoping for, and my attention started to drift. In comparison, Oppenheimer's movie managed to capture it better. Additionally, the non-musical atmosphere in certain scenes felt slow and uninteresting. Leo's character was hard to keep up with, and his lies and ignorance became annoying. I was expecting him to face the consequences he deserved, but the ending, with its Broadway-like twist, left me confused. I had hoped that the movie would respectfully leave the audience wondering about the fate of the Osage people, but I was ultimately disappointed. I wanted to feel an emotional connection, but instead, I was left feeling empty and puzzled. Despite that, I tried my best to appreciate it.",negative
817,"A masterpiece of cinema - beautifully shot, incredible score and sound design, the charters and acting are incredible, with tension throughout the film punctuated by humor and beautiful costumes, landscapes, and set pieces which transport the audience.The experience is even better in IMAX, the combination of Scorsese, De Nero. DiCaprio, and music by Robbie Robertson (who happens to be of native American descent) is a high point for timeless film and art.The coming attractions preceeding the feature were for 2 more super hero movies filled with CGI, noise, and absent of characters, dialog, or vulnerability- Killers of the Flower Moon may mark the end of cinema.",negative
818,"A timely masterpiece. A tale of lies, greed, manipulation, snakes, and justice. I watched through a Biblical lens... so the duality and the bloodline references were spot on. ""Nothing new under the sun""... humanity has greed in its heart and love is the cure for all. Awesome scathing interactions between enemies in certain scenes. Overall this is a story that needs to be told today.... and learned from today. The acting and production and scenery were absolutely stunning and perfect. I was captivated the whole time and thought it was worth every minute up to the very ending. Another DiCaprio favorite to add to my list!",negative
819,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a cinematic masterpiece that commits little to no errors, boasting a phenomenal cast, a director of a lifetime, and a budget larger than Oppenheimer's. It's quite disheartening to witness something with the potential to revive cinema's golden days, like ""Goodfellas,"" overstay its welcome at 3 hours and 30 minutes. To say the least, Scorsese indulged in unnecessary dialogue and side characters, resulting in a decentralized and dull story. This creates a sense that the viewer may just want to skip the spin-off series, convoluting with the main plot.The first act is incredibly strong, flawless even, setting the tone of the environment and establishing the main antagonist and our hero, portrayed by Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. Both stars excel in their roles, creating a believable relationship with subtle writing. The impressive set shot in Oklahoma is indescribable, bringing the town to life in the backgrounds. Many issues I have with this film aren't present in this part. The pacing feels appropriate for a drama and historical piece, with the only notable concern being the mystery, or rather the lack thereof. Several plot points, such as the potential betrayal by the King against Ernest, feel predictable, creating a sense of anticipation throughout the movie. Nonetheless, the film's first impression is commendable, showcasing talented actors and creative cinematography. Overall, it maintains a natural pacing for progression throughout the movie.The middle of the movie doesn't disappoint either, effectively carrying tension between existing storylines into action and portraying the gruesome murders of the Osages. Many shots capture the horrifying aftermath of the killings in creative ways. The story consistently shifts direction, exploring Osage culture and murder plans. Notably, it introduces intriguing scenarios that impact Ernest's relationship with his lover, Mollie. While the plot involving King feels predictable, the dynamics between the couple offer a more subtle and interesting direction.Despite enjoying the second hour, there's room for improvement. For instance, DiCaprio's brother, Bryon, lacks a well-defined character arc and isn't shown in-depth alongside Ernest. Many characters, like Bill Smith, receive ample screen time only to be abruptly killed off, feeling somewhat disconnected from the overarching narrative. The world-building is peculiar, with the first act portraying a more traditional setting, contrasting sharply with the modernized ending. The progression of the cities isn't clearly depicted.In the final part is well, by no means Leonardo DiCaprio starts to under-act and break character, but there's a sense that pacing issues begin to surface. Some emotional beats feel rushed or strangely slow, with a few achieving a satisfying conclusion, such as the end of the relationship between Mollie and the protagonist. The realization that even love couldn't overcome fear was both satisfying and melancholic. However, other elements, like the conclusion of King's empire, are condensed into a three-minute monologue, leaving the fate of the main antagonist feeling rushed.Overall, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" boasts numerous positives, including acting and scenery, making it an above-average movie. However, labeling it a modern masterpiece is questionable, as many of its issues arise from pacing issues. If you can overlook this flaw, you might still find it a movie worth your time. For the general public, it's worth a shot, especially considering the perceived lack of quality in cinema these days.",negative
820,"#KillersOfTheFlowerMoon in theatres.Martin Scorsese is like fine wine, gets better with age. His love for cinema makes him go into yet another uncharted territory to create what might be his bleakest and emotionally distressing story, yet.Much like Scorsese's best known works, the film is framed as an epic, with an in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. A film about a series of real-life killings of wealthy Osage Indians by greedy people was never going to be easy, but it's the execution that sets it apart. It disturbs and creeps up in a manner that is difficult to anticipate.Because of the scale of the theme and plot, the film rightfully earns it's three and a half hours run-time. It needs to explore the different facets with each of the characters, as their actions and consequences thereof make for compelling viewing. While I personally like this compelling viewing approach, it may not be easy for casual viewers. This film requires patience and an attentive mind. The film's intentional slow pacing is used as a means to build tension in the atmosphere. Scorcese relies on this atmosphere as opposed to the fast-paced action of most Hollywood blockbusters.The film is beautifully shot, masterfully edited, with minimal music. There's lots of silence in the sound mix that complements the slow burn style of this filmmaking. And the three leads - Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro - are all deserving of awards recognition. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, have a commanding presence in every scene they're in. But Lily Gladstone's performance is simply remarkable.Martin Scorsese has made a career of painstaking attention to detail and creating movies that linger on long after they are viewed. Here's to many more productions from this master film-maker.This film may not find a wide audience (there were six people in the audience for the show I saw). But if you're interested, then I would urge you to see it in a theatre. This is filmmaking at its finest.",negative
821,"I knew this was going to be a long film, and I heard it might only be in cinemas for a month or so before it moved to streaming, so I wanted to catch it on the big screen while I could, especially as it looked like an ""Oscar Bait"" movie (made to receive Oscar nominations), directed by Oscar, Golden Globe nominated Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Departed, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Irishman). Basically, set in 1919, it opens with the ceremonial burial of a pipe, a symbol of the assimilation into White American society for Osage (Native American Indians) elders. Following this, in an Oklahoma reservation, which features the annual ""flower moon"" phenomenon of fields of blooms, several Osage find oil bursting from the ground. The tribe becomes wealthy from oil revenue, though law requires court-appointed guardians to manage the money, because the Osage are assumed to be ""incompetent"". In the established Fairfax, Osage County, the greedy, unintelligent Ernest Burkhart (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio) has returned from fighting in the First World War to live with his brother Byron (Scott Shepherd) and his uncle William King Hale (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Robert De Niro) on Hale's large reservation ranch. Hale, a reserve deputy sheriff popularly known as ""King"", appears to be a friendly benefactor of the Osage, speaking their language and bestowing gifts. However, he is secretly a crime lord scheming to murder the Osage to steal their wealth. Lacking physical strength for labour jobs, Ernest works for King as a cab driver. King suggests he should get closer to Mollie Kyle (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Lily Gladstone), an Osage whose family owns oil rights and a share of the Osage Mineral Estate. Ernest and Byron commit some armed robberies against the Osage to make some money. Ernest meets Mollie whilst driving her, he charms her, and a romance develops between them, and makes the effort to read books and learn more about the Osage history. After some time, Ernest and Mollie are married in a ceremony mixing Catholic and Osage elements. King plans the deaths of several wealthy Osage. He tells Ernest he will gain an inheritance if more of Mollie's family dies. Mollie has three sisters, Anna Brown (Cara Jade Myers), Rita (JaNae Collins) and Minnie (Jillian Dion), and their elderly mother Lizzie Q (Tantoo Cardinal) is ill. After Minnie dies from a mysterious illness, King orders Byron to kill the rebellious Anna. Lizzie and the Osage council blame the reservation's white residents and urge the tribe to fight back. The 1921 Tulsa race riot is shown in a newsreel, with Whites destroying a thriving Black community and killing numerous people, causing concern amongst the Osage that there could be similar attacks against them. Lizzie sees her ancestors, represented by the arrival of an owl, who welcome her to the afterlife, and she dies in her bed. Ernest loves Mollie and they have children. Nevertheless, King persuades Ernest to poison Mollie's insulin. Ernest is in denial about the damage it causes, as King insisted it would merely ""slow her down."" Mollie's condition worsens, and Ernest sometimes swallows the poisoned medicine himself. King orders the death of Mollie's first husband Henry Roan (William Belleau) to collect his life insurance and has Ernest organise another murder. However, the murder plot is botched by Ernest, and he is brutally paddled by King as punishment. King then orders Ernest to arrange the murders of Mollie's last remaining sister Rita and her husband Bill Smith (Jason Isbell). Their house is set on fire, and they are killed in the explosion. Mollie inherits all her family's headrights. The local sheriff and judges are corrupt and there are no investigations. In Washington, D. C., an Osage nation representative seeking to lobby Congress is murdered. Mollie hires private detective William J. Burns (Gary Basaraba) to investigate crimes in the town, but he is beaten and chased away from the reservation by Ernest and Byron. Despite her illness, Mollie travels with an Osage delegation to Washington and asks President Calvin Coolidge (Mark Landon Smith) for help. Agent Thomas ""Tom"" Bruce White Sr. (Jesse Plemons) is sent by the Bureau of Investigation (what became the FBI years later), along with his assistants, and they soon uncover the truth. King tries to cover his tracks by murdering several of his own hired killers, but he and Ernest are arrested. The agents find Mollie severely ill, and they help her to get proper medical care. White persuades Ernest to testify and turn evidence against King. Hale's attorney W. S. Hamilton (Brendan Fraser) tries to convince Ernest to claim he was tortured and change his mind. However, while in his jail cell, Ernest is informed of the tragic death of one of his daughters from pertussis, a contagious violent cough, and he has emotional breakdown. He decides to confess in court and turns against his uncle. King unsuccessfully tries to have Ernest murdered. Mollie meets with Ernest after he testifies but leaves him when he will not admit to poisoning her. Later, a filmed report for a radio show reveals what happened next. Ernest and King were convicted and received life sentences for murder. Both were incarcerated for many years, but despite Osage protests, they were paroled. Byron served no time in prison because of a hung jury. The Shoun brothers, doctors James (Steve Witting) and David (Steve Routman), who helped Ernest providing him the insulin and the poison to administer to Mollie, were implicated in other ""wasting deaths"", but were not prosecuted due to lack of evidence. Mollie divorced Ernest after the trial. She remarried and died of diabetes, aged 50 in 1937. She was buried alongside her parents, sisters, and daughter. Her obituary did not refer to the Osage murders. The final scene seen from a birds eye view sees many Osage celebrating their surviving culture in a large tribal dance. Also starring John Lithgow as Prosecutor Peter Leaward, Louis Cancelmi as Kelsie Morrison, Everett Waller as Paul Red Eagle, Talee Redcorn as Non-Hon-Zhin-Ga / Traditional Leader, Yancey Red Corn as Chief Bonnicastle, Tatanka Means as John Wren, Tommy Schultz as Blackie Thompson, Sturgill Simpson as Henry Grammar, Ty Mitchell as John Ramsey, Charlie Musselwhite as Alvin Reynolds, Pat Healy as Agent John Burger, Michael Abbott Jr. As Agent Frank Smith, Randy Houser as Scott Mathis, The White Stripes' Jack White as Radio Show Actor, Barry Corbin as Undertaker Turton, Steve Eastin as Judge John C. Pollock, Larry Fessenden as Radio Voice, Vince Giordano as Radio Show Bandleader, and Martin Scorsese as Radio Show Producer. DiCaprio with his constantly grimacing expression is interesting as the former war veteran turned criminal, De Niro is terrific as being nice on the surface but understatedly sinister, and Gladstone (the first Native American Indian Oscar nominee) does almost steal the show as the innocent Native American wife endangered and suffering but getting her moments to fight back. The story is based on the real-life Osage Indian murders, the film takes its time telling the story, but it is an exhausting and rather testing three and half hours, I cannot fully agree with the overrated praise from critics because of the length. The positives I can give it are Scorsese's direction, the great performances, the period detail and atmosphere, the surprising moments (the paddling and house blowing up scenes), the editing from Scorsese's constant collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, and the score by Robbie Robertson, I just wish it could have been a little shorter, but it is a worthwhile enough epic western crime drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Score for Robbie Robertson, Best Original Song for ""Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)"", Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Casting, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing for Thelma Schoonmaker, Best Make Up & Hair, Original Score, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score for Robbie Robertson, and Best Screenplay for Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese. Very good!",negative
822,"There are some directors whose every new movie is 'an event', a film we have to seek out and judge for ourselves even if the initial reviews have been less than enthusiastic. We must compare these new films with the director's previous work to see where it sits in the canon. Scorsese is clearly one such director and his gigantic ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", a marathon at around three and a half hours, is one such 'event'. In some circles it has been called a masterpiece and Scorsese's best film in decades. I don't agree with either of these assessments but it is certainly unmissable in its own right and a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling.Based on fact it's about the Native Americans of the Osage tribe who found themselves on oil-rich land making them among the richest people in the country, (even if they were still among the most discriminated against), and of how cattle baron William Hale, (Robert De Niro), their supposed friend and benefactor, sought to take their wealth from them even if it meant killing them off one by one.However, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is not quite like a Scorsese picture; the pace is stately rather than kinetic and it's often more talkative than visual. There are a few of the director's trademark flourishes such as the customary tracking shots but they don't draw attention to themselves. This is very much a heavily plot-based film and it unfolds more like a novel than a film and one relying heavily on its cast.The central roles are played by Scorsese regulars Leonardo DiCaprio and De Niro and newcomer Lily Gladstone. DiCaprio is the nephew returned from war, a heavy drinker and a weak-willed man, who will do anything for his uncle De Niro, including murder. He's a dour character and DiCaprio plays him dourly. There is no boyish charm on display, (even at age 48 DiCaprio still looks boyish), and while he is more than adequate in the role he still feels miscast, maybe a little too 'modern' for a man of the time. De Niro, on the other hand, is magnificent. In his case this really is his best work in decades, a smiling villain as finely drawn as any created by Shakespeare and he is surely a front runner for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.The most difficult role, however, is Gladstone's. She is the rich Osage woman that DiCaprio must woo, marry and dispose of. In the first half of the film she clearly has the upper hand, taking the initiative and using her sexuality to her advantage while in the second half she begins to fade into the background yet must continue to make an impression; she must remain the film's centre of attention and this Gladstone does beautifully.Indeed, in a large cast there are several outstanding supporting performances from the likes of Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, Scott Shepherd, Ty Mitchell and country singers Jason Isbell and Sturgill Simpson and they ensure the tale flows freely and never feels like its length. It may not be the best of Scorsese's films or the late masterpiece we might have been hoping for; it feels too 'matter-of-fact' and despite its length almost too constrained by the weight of its subject matter but it is still essential viewing, an 'event' movie worthy of the name. It also has probably the best last ten minutes of any movie you are likely to see this year.",negative
823,"This movie is well worth watching for the excellent acting, writing and directing. The landscapes depicted, the costumes and the buildings really transport you to another era.I was pleased to learn about this era and the injustices committed against the Osage people, although the subject is very tragic and these types of events don't really come with a happy ending. I would recommend people to watch it even though it has it's flaws.It is quite slow paced though. Due to its length I wonder if it would have worked better in a miniseries format alternatively the movie may have benefitted from being shortened.",negative
824,"A towering achievement. The grandeur of the film's structure reveals itself in a powerful scene towards the end, to which the whole, carefully-paced, brilliantly-acted edifice has been leading. Not a minute too long, not a detail too small. I love Scorsese's work. This seems to me to be his crowning glory. Maybe it's got something to do with the fact that for the first time there is a female character who is as important to the story as the males who are usually the centre of attention. Lily Gladstone is mesmerising, easily holding her own opposite Leonard DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. Superb supporting players include Jesse Plemons and Tantoo Cardinal. Photography, editing, music...great. All at the service of a sorry tale, around a century ago, of avarice, duplicity and self-deception. The world, unfortunately, hasn't changed that much.",negative
825,"Had a very interesting feeling exiting the theatre on this screening of a Martin Scorsese film. It was the first time I had truly left the film, despising by the main characters, truly finding them disgusting and off-putting people. Even though many of his films are about truly awful people, you still find a way to like them in some strange way. But I could not find it in this film to enjoy the main characters played by Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert De Niro. And I believe that is what was intended as they were truly horrible man. The person you're going to find a love to is the character played by Lily Gladstone She has a warm loveliness to her That makes Her one of the few characters you enjoy spending Time within the film. The performances from all the Characters are very interesting, especially Robert De Niro. I've not truly ever seen the man play a character such as this as he is usually the New York type of character this. Country Tycoon is very interesting and it's very enjoyable to see him play this character. I have never been a large fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I do believe he played this week character. I Thinks he's Gifted very well to this type of role. The feel of the film is very interesting with very different styles of culture in these film that you don't normally see in this type of period film. I highly recommend you see this film even though it is a free hour-long film. It did not feel like it dragged at any time Though I did see it in the middle of the afternoon. So, after the screening, did not feel exhausted. I still had time left in my day. Now that more film seemed to be going the three-hour length these days, I do recommend not seeing these types of films in the late hours of the day. But so many of them are worth seeing. So, we'll just have to make time for them, I believe.",negative
826,"It wasn't that good to be fair.It's not that it was long because a movie can be long and worth it and this one was not.They squandered a good story.It should have been shot and told from the Osage's point of view. It would have had more emotional impact told from the Osage point of view.Instead they gave us a movie that lacked emotional impact, jumped around and felt disjointed at times. Sometimes you couldn't tell exactly what was happening in some scenes. Someone would be shot by someone else and we didn't know who was being shot, where, by who or for what reason.I remember a scene when someone called someone said so young super abrupt but we weren't even sure who the parties on either end of the phone call, what the point of the call was or what it had to do with anything.Also, why would they try to make Mollie's husband look in any way sympathetic.I don't buy that he really loved his wife because when you love someone you don't break her heart and make her suffer by killing her family and then also slowly poisoning her. He knew he was giving her something that was not good for her even if his uncle didn't tell him what it was.I wish I had started with Millie's children or grandchildren telling the story of what happened. This BS about move her husband's point of view and trying to make him look conflicted or like he actually loved his wife feels like another disservice to the Osage and specifically to Mollie and her family.In general, it was a miss in the story telling, the directing and the editing too.Sadly, it was a waste of a great historical story. They could have made this movie amazing but they didn't.I don't blame the actors, who have great performances despite the bad script and directing.Scorsese is loosing his touch.Also, give Lily Gladstone all of the awards!",negative
827,"I think there is no argument that Martin Scorsese is the greatest director in cinema history and of course he continues to impress with ever film he makes. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is most definitely a passion piece for Martin, and you can tell with how intensely driven the picture is. Now yes, this film had the crime/violence flare Scorsese is known for, but it did establish more of a romantic take on the story to help establish deeper connections with the characters and the events that took place on the land of the Osage Nation. With strong themes of greed and betrayal, I found myself fully emersed in this story and the authenticity of the characters in every scene. With the power duo of Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio performing at their typical standard and giving great performances, you'd think there wasn't anyone who can outperform them; however, Lily Gladstone was able to match their level with ease, and I was blown away with her amazing performance every time she graced the screen. Moreover, visually the film was beautiful with set design and cinematography it produced a stunning piece of art.For me personally the only issue from this film was that the 3-hour and 26-minute runtime was felt the whole way through. As much as I was engaged the entire time and enjoyed this film, it was one that I can easily tell was long. While not my favourite Scorsese film, still easily one of his bests.",negative
828,"What this latest installment in Martin Scorsese's filmography has taught me is that he is for sure a very very versatile director. Not only is he capable of making a film about absolutely anything at this point, but each and every one of his pictures feels so different to the rest. I seriously would not have been able to tell that this was a Scorsese flick if I hadn't have known beforehand (and also if it wasn't for that final scene). With Killers of the Flower Moon (2023), he has made one of the most poignant, thought-provoking movies of his career so far. It is one that by the end of things leaves you struggling to fathom how on Earth such a heartlessly murderous era could be lost and forgotten in American history.And as a result of Lily Gladstone putting in what was, in my opinion, the best performance out of the entire cast (to the point where I literally forgot that she was even acting, like genuinely when I left the theater I thought ""wow Leo and De Niro were incredible"", and I completely missed out Gladstone because her performance felt so real that it felt like I was simply watching her play herself), it makes the murders all the more heartbreaking & brutal, and it makes the money-grubbing murderers come across all the more callous & cold-hearted, as we connect and become emotionally invested in the Osage tribe through her character, and it's easy to do so thanks to her warm & amiable personality being portrayed excellently.And to top it all off, the little man himself made a shock appearance towards the end, which really drove home the feeling of deep sadness which was already consuming my mind enough as it was. It was this particular scene that legitimately elevated my rating for this feature, as it highlights how this isn't just some project to him. No, rather, it highlights how this is a story that wholeheartedly moved him when he first heard of it, and now his goal is to get us to experience the same flurry of emotions as he did. And he executed that goal marvellously.But to quickly explain why I haven't given a 5-star rating, I will firstly say that this did not need to be and shouldn't have been a 3Â½ hour film. Even though there was no moment that dragged, there were some scenes that could've been cut without any major effect on the story. Perhaps I'm just saying this because I was fairly tired during the first act and found myself nearly falling asleep & failing to concentrate, but to be clear that's not because it was boring (because it wasn't) but simply because I was tired in the first place, and consequently I was very conscious of the time from early on in the movie, and so by the time we reached the end, it did feel like quite a stretch. But regardless, I do think my argument still stands. But apart from that, I guess it just didn't have as much of an impact on me as I'd hoped for, so I perhaps just got my expectations up a tad too high.But in conclusion, this is a picture which can be very touching, and it is one which I definitely recommend to anybody who somehow hasn't seen this by now.",negative
829,"I eagerly anticipated the release of this next Scorsese film. Excited about DiCaprio and DeNiro teaming up with Scorsese at the helm but I feel let down.Extremely depressing and slow paced for a 3 hour experience. Needed to be reduced by 30-45 minutes due to the somber nature of the film.Beautifully shot and performances were strong though I would have preferred Lily Gladstone with a larger role. As the Lead Actress, I would have liked more dialogue for her. She carried herself with quiet strength and was fantastic. DiCaprio was again top notch and I enjoyed DeNiro's take on the greedy, conniving Bill Hale.Perhaps it deserves another watch.",negative
830,"There are several aspects of this film that have to be taken and rated separately. The settings, the acting, the music, everything is spot on from the viewpoint of the film production.Then there is the subject, one worth knowing and it alone making this movie worth it, however it is a grueling story to endure, for the entire length of this film, which is over three hours. If you had any doubts about the systematic eradication of the Native Americans through any means by the colonists, as recent as the 1920s, when the story takes place, this film is going to dispel them. It will show you human greed and ugliness to levels that are hard to suffer. You will have to witness this filth without any redeeming qualities for the people involved, no entertainment value in the story.Based on a non-fiction book written by a reporter, these are real events, presented slowly and methodically, without anything that would make the film entertaining. And while mentioning the slowness and the length, let me also tell you that the film ends with a radio show like production of 20 minutes that storytells the ending. So, after three hours of basically psychological torture and snuff porn, Martin Scorsese needed to summarize what went on next, otherwise there would have been another three hours I guess.Bottom line: a dramatized documentary you need emotional fortitude to go through, and at the end all you get to feel is despair and no hope for humanity.",negative
831,"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) ;
Brief Review -Kills too much time to explore the flowering stage of the FBI and moon-plated Osage murders. I don't know what came into Martin Scorsese's mind when he decided to make a 200-minute+ film in today's era when things are looking boring and far stretched even in the 150 minutes. It's good sometimes when you have something that's really engaging and interesting-take Avatar 2 and Oppenheimer for Instance (from recent times)-but sadly, this non-fiction novel-based film didn't have enough to stretch your eyes for 3 and a half hours. The film is set in the early 20th century and follows the murders of Osage (done for money and land). It's so obvious to see that everything's going as planned. People keep getting murdered, and then there is no investigation, but what about social awareness amongst the community? Mollie seemed so clever when she observed things here and there, and then we had to see her going blind against her husband. Earnest was a part of the crime syndicate, but he never thought that things were planned for him as well. His love story with Mollie looked so fake right from the first scene. One small conversation over a tip of smoking, and the next moment they were kissing each other and talking about marriage. Some true love between an Indian woman and a white man when things are getting worse all over the town. Hale did look greedy and smart, but not enough to beat the FBI and Law. Things were so easy and had no thrills that Martin Scorsese himself had to appear and tell us that there was ""no mention of murders."" Come on, we all knew it. It wasn't really that bad, but why take 200 minutes for that? Leonardo, Robert, and Lily are fab in their roles, and you should watch this film for their performances. Scorsese's direction has its own highs and lows here, but what a terrific use of camera and background score! Full marks for that.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest.",negative
832,"Scorsese's latest work, ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" unfolds as a profound exploration of an overlooked slice of American history. In his distinctive style, the acclaimed director weaves a narrative of genuine tragedies, skillfully brought to life by a stellar cast embodying historical figures.DiCaprio and De Niro deliver performances that captivate, navigating a complex tapestry of emotions. Lily Gladstone's portrayal adds a touch of poignant tragedy. What sets this film apart is its capacity to transcend the confines of a typical historical drama-it unfolds as a captivating mystery, shedding light on the shadowy facets of American history.The cinematography and production design seamlessly transport us to the 1920s Osage Nation, immersing us in an authentic atmosphere. It demands patience, echoing the deliberate pace characteristic of Scorsese's finest works.While DiCaprio's expressions and a familiar tone in the final act provide minor detours, the film's true essence lies in its extensive exploration of unsettling themes, reminiscent of Shoah's deep dive into pervasive evil.In their sixth collaboration, DiCaprio displays his range, navigating a character torn between loyalty and moral conflict. De Niro, in a supporting role, embodies the malevolent antagonist, unveiling the darkness beneath seemingly justifiable actions.Yet, it's Lily Gladstone who steals the spotlight, embodying resilience amid pain. Her portrayal of Mollie becomes the beating heart of the narrative, encapsulating positive values amid the tragedy's backdrop.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" transcends being a mere film; it stands as a preservation of history, a captivating addition to Scorsese's repertoire. Shedding light on a neglected historical episode, it offers a cinematic experience that commands reflection.For the history enthusiast and Scorsese aficionado, this film promises a riveting journey-a cinematic gem safeguarding a crucial slice of history for generations to come. Remember, those who neglect history risk its haunting repetition.",negative
833,"You know the commercial I think in the 70s or 80s that was so popular and it was about where is what's important. Everything about the production was spectacular and almost never seen. This is on the level of 'heaven's gate' which was a tremendous flop in it's day. Tons of details and lots of moving parts and presumably designed meticulously for the time period. The acting was amazing too and especially leonardo dicaprio for his understated portrayal of someone dragged easily into a web of murder and conspiracy. His ticks in the movie are fun to watch but where's the story. The production design, the staging, the photography, the acting are top notch in every scene but the story is missing and so you lose most of the emotional bond to what the story claims to be, which is cultural racism that is so bad that murder is overlooked. As one character put it, you'd get more attention if someone killed a dog. The story is missing and so are many parts that the story claims to be about. Scorsese is great at scenes but not story telling most of the time. Not sure how accurate 'kundun' is but it's also an amazing production and it has a story told in an amazing way. This is just a lot of money throw at a film that's too long and pointless. He should have rewatched 'kundun' before this one. Btw, I checked and kundun wasn't written by scorsese but this one is so maybe that's the problem.",negative
834,The movie and the book are obviously bound for the obvious denouement of revealing the plot of a huge and complex willingness to murder for massive wealth.But the details in the apparent random murders over years that eventually reveal the perpetrators become mysterious plates in the film that are revealed in the book.The Sawing of Anna's skull in the autopsy is grotesque unless you know the sewers are Doctors who evidently hid the bullet that killed her.I am frustrated that Earnest Burkhardt remained so enigmatic through the film. His scenes with King Hale add to the air of he either being an absolute idiot or just devoid of consciousness.But I studied the book and the movie and agree it could have been shorter. I think the information from the Court Scenes and the meeting of Earnest and the Hale group could have been more gracefully resolved.But it remains a great story and a great movie.,negative
835,"Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a grim and gritty affair, a Western crime drama that plumbs the depths of American history with a steady, unflinching gaze. Based on the non-fiction book by David Grann, the film adapts a true story of the Osage Nation from the 1920s, bringing to light an often-overlooked chapter with his trademark cinematic flair. However, while it boasts impressive craftsmanship and a stellar ensemble cast, the end result is a somewhat underwhelming addition to Scorsese's body of work.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" centers on a string of mysterious murders within the Osage Nation, as members of the tribe are killed one by one, their deaths shrouded in suspicion and greed. The film takes its time setting the stage, immersing viewers in the dusty, dangerous world of 1920s Oklahoma, where oil prospects and tribal sovereignty converge in a volatile mix. Scorsese's direction is confident and assured, expertly weaving together a complex web of characters and motivations. The pacing may be methodical, but it suits the story's slow-burn nature, allowing tension to build as the bodies pile up and the truth remains elusive.The film's strong suit is undoubtedly its cast. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro headline as conspirators whose motives and actions drive the narrative. DiCaprio, in particular, delivers a nuanced performance, his character's complexity providing a moral ambiguity that keeps the audience guessing. However, it is Lily Gladstone, who plays the wife of DiCaprio's character and a member of the Osage Nation, who truly shines. Her portrayal of a woman caught in a web of tragedy and conspiracy is powerful and poignant, offering a much-needed perspective that grounds the film in its historical context.While the performances are across-the-board impressive, the film's impact is lessened by its excessive runtime. Clocking in at 210 minutes, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" tests the audience's endurance. The story's pacing, already deliberate, becomes labored, and the film's emotional resonance is diluted by its own overindulgence. This is a shame because the film boasts stunning cinematography and a evocative score that, when combined with strong performances, should have resulted in a more affecting experience. Instead, the end product feels bloated, leaving viewers wishing for a tighter edit that could have elevated the film's overall impact.That being said, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is by no means a disappointment. Scorsese remains a master of his craft, and the film is a visually stunning and thematically rich addition to the Western genre. The subject matter is handled with respect and nuance, offering a glimpse into a little-known chapter of American history. While the lengthy runtime may deter some viewers, those who stick with it will find themselves engrossed in a compelling, if flawed, tale.In conclusion, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a film that aims high, boasting impressive production values and a weighty story. While it falls short of greatness due to its excessive length and somewhat muted emotional impact, it is nonetheless a thought-provoking and well-crafted entry in Scorsese's oeuvre. A grim but important story, beautifully told-flaws and all.",negative
836,"I love Scorsese, Leo, DeNiro and the like. The acting was great, the story is important. However, it was told in a slow drawn out fashion that made it hard to follow, die to lick of interest. I typically love his long form movies: Gangs of New York, Wolf of Wall Street, The Irishman etc.This does not hold the same pace or interest of any of the aforementioned movies. I'm not unhappy that I watched it, because it was a good movie. That being said, I likely won't watch it again because it was so long and not interest piquing enough to entice me.Go see it I suppose, but you could just as soon watch it on Netflix and be able to pause or watch in 2 pieces.",negative
837,"A film that is worth seeing. While Killers of the Flower Moon takes its time to tell its story, it doesn't drag much. It succeeds to arouse its viewers with its scenic roots of the Osage people, letting you become aware of how they're blatantly mistreated and maliciously invaded by the white supremacists that is still known today. Perhaps, it is an ongoing cancer as to how racism & poverty still exists and how power and greed is used for a white man's gain.Needless to say, Killers of the Flower Moon is empowering. Scorsese tells the story with justice, and with ease, still with the same themes of an abusive power, all for money.This one is still sinking into my brain and one I would never forget. Lily Gladstone was delivered, a performance that would always be memorable.",negative
838,4 out of 5 stars.Killers of the Flower Moon is a good epic crime drama film about the story of the Osage murders. When natives of Osage discovered oil. Mysterious deaths started happening to the natives who owned the lands.Plot is good and powerful. Great cast ensemble with Leonardo Dicaprio and Robert Di Niro delivering. Lily Gladstone also did great. The script did a great job developing the story. May be slow moving with its direction as it builds the story. It is a 3 hr and 26 mins film which Martin Scorsese does take his time developing the story without rushing into it. It is a tough story to see which money and greed changes people. Even if they have to manipulate and lie to get what they want.It is one long film which may be hard to sit through without breaks. But the story and direction kept me glued to the screen.,negative
839,"The film tells the story of the Osage, a Native American tribe that was nearly wiped out. The reason for this tragedy was the immense wealth the Osage gained from oil. The film impressively shows how boundless greed can collectively drive people and how easily one looks away, simply because the victims have a different skin color.Masterfully performed by Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, and Robert De Niro. What I particularly liked was how Leo took a completely different approach with his character Ernest this time. His demeanor, facial expressions, and mannerisms are so different that from the beginning, I saw Ernest, not Leo.It was certainly a fine line to write this script. On one hand, the drama must not fall short to avoid boring the audience. On the other hand, one wants to pay respect to the many, many dead and tell their story as honestly as possible. Scorsese masterfully succeeds in this. One should not expect a classic drama from the outset; rather, a down-to-earth approach is pursued. With this knowledge, I had a lot of fun and found the film very exciting-at least for the first two-thirds. In the last hour, the film falls apart somewhat and ends the storylines too abruptly. I found this unfortunate, as Scorsese had taken his time until then. With a runtime of almost 3.5 hours, I would have liked a more consistent tension curve.All in all, I was very well entertained. The sets, costumes, and actors are all at the masterful level one expects from Scorsese. However, I would have liked a more rounded experience with the script.",negative
840,A perfectly made film exposing the KKK and the Masons for what they have done in the past while amusing the movie goers. This film is well done and nicely documented exposing the past of our forefathers the corruption that is current in our world today as if was then. Greed above all.Great acting and a perfect storyline! The cast in this film pulled it all off beautifully bringing this story to life. Sadly no matter the story exposing the past like all films its just for entertainment and not to bring any repairs to what happen or bringing the corrupt to their trials.Highly recommended film to watch.,negative
841,"Just how many masterpieces can one man have? I ask,because every one involved in this wonderful movie. The atmosphere Scorsese had created is amazing. You can almost smell the dirt and taste the air. Shear excellence and worth every penny of its budget.It's hard to see how he could have accomplished it without a simply masterful performance from all of its actors. The lighting,photography design, wardrobe and sound are perfection . All of this has enabled the master to conjure a picture that evokes time and place like any I've. Seen in a long time.Last but not least, the radio show epilogue was a stroke of genius.",negative
842,"I wasn't sold on the ending. The orchestrated reading session seemed spontaneous, almost like an afterthought to rush the ending. It is strange to me how many people are complaining about the length of the movie. Phantom of the Opera broke me in a long time ago and that was brutal for me. This film is not tiktok approved. Meaning it's not a 30 second dopamine hit, but it is well worth the watch. Get your snacks and get ready to listen to a story unfold. We could haveused a bit of closed captioning but honestly, aside from missing out on the exact verbiage I only felt the frustration of not understanding for a short moment and it drew in a bit more . Leo aced it... in my most humble opinion.",negative
843,"Overblown and dull.Nothing happens; the story is obvious; the acting is so-so (both DiCaprio and De Niro were on autopilot unless you count DiCaprio's permanently scrunched face as 'acting' - plus the other 'big-name' actors get three lines each); it is WAY too long... at two hours it would have been a bit too much, but three and a half? Didn't 'Heaven's Gate' get panned for it's overlong running time? That was a far more entertaining film than this!There is just one story running through the whole film; no sub-plots, no twists, not even any other characters than the main three and none of them were particularly well-written and had almost no backstory or development throughout the film.Plus a big fat zero for cinematography. Given it was some grassland and and a Hollywood set but there was no attempt at atmosphere. No 'artsy' stunning sunset shots or silhouettes of the characters looking moody against the skyline. Just flat, boring shots of nothing.And if you want to highlight the story of the Native Americans in the USA having them almost entirely as extras in a film about their past doesn't really cut it.This is so obviously someone's (Scorsese's?) latest pet obsession where they got lost and couldn't see past the end of their nose.Avoid.",negative
844,"Any way you look at it, Scorsese is not only one of the greatest living directors, but one of the greatest and most important directors ever. For several decades, he has been creating films about topics that interest him, with the actors he wants and in the way he wants. This film is no exception either.Scorsese is still at the highest level he has maintained for years and it is a real refreshment, maybe even an honor (now someone will say I am exaggerating), that we can watch his films in our time.The film deals with a topic that the director is very interested in, he wanted to make a film about it for years. It's about the murders of the Osage Indians because of the oil they discovered on their land. Greed for money, status and power was relevant 100 years ago, and it is still relevant today, unfortunately. The first thing that catches your eye is the length of the film, 3 and a half hours is by no means small, but the film is so well made, with great pace and direction, that I didn't feel the length of time that much. I've seen half-length films that I couldn't wait for to end. In today's age, I think that this will bother many people. The film should last as long as it should. I even missed a little more of the film because I expected some characters to be a little longer in the film or some events, that they would end differently. It's as if they cut a little too much, however paradoxical it may sound after watching 200+ minutes.The trio of actors who carry the film are, as expected, old acquaintances De Niro and Di Caprio, who did everything according to a certain routine, which can be both a good and a bad thing, but I must mention the actress Lily Gladstone who was side by side in the mentioned duet. A difficult, complex character with a life that did not bring her roses.I have to say in the end that this is one of the best films of the year, but it is by no means one of the best in Scorsese's long career, it is probably in the upper half, but that says a lot, a lot. It's not a perfect film, not even close, but I'm very happy with the final product and I'm glad that Scorsese is still at his best. I can truly say that they really don't make movies like this anymore.",negative
845,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a gripping cinematic journey that delves into a dark and unsettling chapter of American history. Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film offers a powerful exploration of the Osage Indian murders that occurred in the 1920s, unraveling a tale of greed, corruption, and the early days of the FBI.At the forefront of this cinematic masterpiece is an ensemble cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. DiCaprio, once again, delivers a standout performance as Ernest Burkhart, a complex character caught in the web of conspiracy. His portrayal brings a poignant authenticity to the narrative, capturing the emotional depth of the story.The film's cinematography, under the keen eye of Rodrigo Prieto, is nothing short of breathtaking. The sweeping landscapes and meticulous attention to detail transport the audience to the hauntingly beautiful yet treacherous terrain of Osage County. The visual elements work in tandem with the narrative, creating an immersive experience that lingers in the mind.As the plot unfolds, the audience is introduced to the sinister plot that targeted the Osage Nation, who, after discovering oil on their lands, became victims of a calculated conspiracy. The sense of foreboding is masterfully crafted, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats as the mystery deepens.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to balance historical significance with engaging storytelling. Scorsese, known for his deft handling of intricate narratives, navigates the complexities of David Grann's source material with finesse. The script, penned by Eric Roth, captures the nuances of the true events, providing both a historical lesson and a thrilling cinematic experience.The chemistry between DiCaprio and De Niro, stalwarts of the acting world, is palpable. Their on-screen dynamic adds another layer to the film, especially as the characters grapple with moral dilemmas and the quest for justice. Jesse Plemons, as Tom White, the lead investigator, also deserves commendation for his compelling portrayal.The film's pacing, although deliberate, contributes to the sense of unease that permeates the narrative. Scorsese takes his time to build the tension, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the atmosphere of suspicion and fear that shrouded the Osage community during that tumultuous period.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is not merely a crime drama; it's a reflection on systemic injustice and the resilience of those who fought against it. The haunting score by longtime Scorsese collaborator Robbie Robertson underscores the emotional weight of the narrative, heightening the impact of key moments.While the film is undoubtedly a triumph, it may not be suitable for those seeking a lighthearted escape. The subject matter is dark, and the film unflinchingly confronts the atrocities committed against the Osage people. However, it is precisely this willingness to confront uncomfortable truths that makes ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" a significant and necessary cinematic achievement.In conclusion, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a cinematic tour de force that transcends its genre. With a compelling narrative, stellar performances, and impeccable craftsmanship, Scorsese delivers a film that resonates on both an emotional and intellectual level. It's a haunting exploration of a forgotten chapter in American history that demands to be seen and remembered.",negative
846,"Sometimes you can see a film that is too damn bleak and too damn brilliant. If only Scorsese wasn't so effective as a filmmaker. If only Eric Roth wasn't so great as a storyteller. While I was watching the film I realized again that Scorsese, like Spielberg, has cinematic storytelling in his DNA. Killers of the Flower Moon is a panoramic, paranoid, perception of putrefying politics. Be warned, the cinematic energy amplifies the darkness.As I sat through the film I had two conflicting feelings; appreciation for the craft of filmmaking and sadness for the history on screen. It was long, but I was never bored, I was on the edge of my seat. I have no idea how accurate the film is to history. I do intend to find out. I did not follow all the details in the story, but by the end the plot had more clarity. I had an intense fear that the ending would be beyond depressing. However the ending was not as sad as I feared.And, YES, it is much better than Napoleon. Napoleon was another epic about how a Man's ego can be a Weapon of Mass Destruction. Napoleon had two great scenes, and about fifty vacuous scenes.Martin Scorsese is on my Heros List. A skilled filmmaker who can face unpleasant history with passion. And he is 81 years old as of Dec. 2023P. S. I hope Mr. Tarantino reconsiders his plans to retire. The work of Ridley Scott and Martin Scorsese is proof that age is not always a vice.",negative
847,"It keeps going and going until everyone we care about is dead, dying or behind bars, with nearly an hour still in store. Scorsese extracts an epic Western from horrible real-life crimes committed against the Native American Osage tribe of, latterly, Oklahoma, delivering something biblical, human, yet deeply inhumane. DiCaprio and De Niro are brilliant, but it is relative unknown Lily Gladstone who is truly extraordinary. The three-and-a-half-hour running time is fully justified in an escalating tragedy that never loosens its grip - a sordid illustration of historical erasure with echoes in today's bitterly divisive political gamesmanship. And so, for better or worse, Scorsese turns Killers of the Flower Moon into the kind of story that he can still tell better than anyone else: A story about greed, corruption, and the mottled soul of a country that was born from the belief that it belonged to anyone callous enough to take it..!? Admiration to all cast and crew..!?",negative
848,"It's a mix of sensations.The film doesn't hide what it's going for, it's clear about the objectives of the ""bad guys"" from the beginning, you know perfectly well where it's going, you know that there will have to be a detour so that the bad guys don't laugh until the end.In other words, up to a certain point (and this point is very close to the end) you know where the film is going and what the contours of the film will be like.I admit that in the end I was surprised. I expected a big clichÃ© when it comes to characters redeeming themselves and correcting their mistakes. But it didn't happen. The characters remained real to themselves. The way they decided to tell the end of the story was an interesting and funny novelty that takes away some weight from the story.The film is long, but it looks good, without any major dead moments. Prepare your bladder before entering.",negative
849,"The Good: Lily Gladstone deserves an Oscar just for sitting through this ""epic"" slog, pouring her all into a thankless role, where she deserved to have way more lines and material to chew on. Deniro was great playing evil to his best ability. The story was great, but the book already explained it better. The costumes, setting, and time period were extremely well done, but that seems to be the gimmick.The Bad: The top investigator and FBI, whose perspective that the book was written, were relegated to the backseat and a Jesse Plemons Columbo is in sleepwalking mode so that the movie can self-indulge into Dicaprio's and Deniro's big egos, Dicaprio overrated as always in this. The Osage victims are done no justice, and what is this expressed as an actual study on? It should've studied deeper into the great Osage people, but they were mere background actors. It's way too long with no rewatch value and not even on a spectacle level like one-watch Oppenheimer. The final ten minutes were an absolute joke and fraudulent.I'll give it a 4/10 just as an investment into future sleeping assistance and for Gladstone's suffering in having to be a part of this mess.4/10.",negative
850,"Another fascinating story-driven film by Martin Scorsese...
All the three main actors played their roles well.The rhythm of the film was excellent, especially starting to tell the main story at the beginning of the film, and you can easily connect with the story of the film.The story did not want to deal with how the FBI was formed, because in this way the main story would be sidelined and the story of the serial murders would not be told well.The length of the movie did not bother me at all.The music was very good in the text of the movie.I loved the way it ended with that radio theater performance.",negative
851,"Watching 'Killers of the Flower Moon' made me feel ashamed to be human, sometimes it felt hard to breathe even, it was very dark. The script is based on a true story which makes you question reality at times, how deceitful and evil can people really become?The actor performances are top-notch which makes you identify with the characters, and as you progress further into the story the feeling of guilt weighs heavier until it almost becomes unbearable. Martin Scorsese, the director, really takes you on a psychological ride which will be hard to forget.I watch a lot of films and don't easily get affected by gritty violence or love stories, but this one really got to me, in a good way, it makes you think a lot because you are sometimes rooting for these characters in the hope that at least one of them will question their actions as they spiral into new depths of evil.I'm rating this film based on how bad it made me feel, so in other words, highly recommended, a masterpiece.",negative

Good thing they added some action because the length of the movie was a bit long u need patience for this one. Scenery was good, and the atmosphere was there even tough that have been could have done better. I think it missed the wow effect on the scenery and on the plot. Overall definitely worth the popcorn and one time watch. Sincerely -Jere.",negative
853,"It's a long movie, but absolutely fascinating. You would think that with so much time, the pacing would become boring, but that wasn't the case. With the editing, the acting, and even the narrative, it was always smooth and captivating. There was always something happening that caused shifts in the storyline, which kept me hooked throughout the entire journey. In fact, I would dare to say that I didn't feel the three and a half hours. Literally, they flew by for me. The only thing that didn't quite convince me was the way they presented the ending, because-although creative-it wasn't entirely satisfying for me. Maybe they wanted to rush it, considering it was already a very long movie, but I would have been willing to watch another half hour just to see the successive events. Additionally, I'm very happy that Mollie survived and that all the scoundrels paid for their sins. By the way, I also find it fascinating that this happened in real life, and that it was the first major case handled by the newly established FBI under Hoover. It's not like he had a good reputation, but-at least-in this case, justice prevailed, or something close to justice, since-it seems- they all walked free, regretting their crimes.",negative
854,Would be a 10/10 if shorter. Defiantly dragged a lot and only the performances from the main cast kept the movie alive.Some movies need 3 + hours to tell the story. This one didn't. It easily could have been an a half an hour or more shorter and not have lacked anything.Oppenheimer is a great example of a movie that was appropriately long and needed the total runtime to tell the story.There are a lot of very well done aspects of this movie but the pacing really puts a damper on things.Fantastic acting and cinematography.Very depressing and is void of happiness. Very heavy handed.This is definitely worth seeing but I would wait till it's streaming.,negative
855,"It's criminal how such a good line up can result in something so utterly average. It had everything - murder, betrayal, ethical dilemmas, great cast, great director, but wow was it easily the worst thing De Caprio has done in a long time.The twist is given away far too early and then the film drags on for another 2 hours.There is no pay-off at the end. No suspense, no drama, barely any action.The deep, ethereal, enchanting and hard-hitting trailer is full of intrigue but don't expect anything but a long sigh in the actual film.There are so many ways this could have been a better film - could be shorter, could give the twist away at the end, etc etcThe cinematography is the only good quality about this film. It's nice to look at, sometimes.Anyone rating this a masterpiece is 100% blowing smoke.",negative
856,"A strong production from Scorsese. Well crafted, with excellent performances from the veteran famous actors (De Niro and DiCaprio)That said, the Native American actors were also excellent as they played the characters of their ancestors. In particular, young Lily Gladstone played the role of Molly Burkhart well and with presence.The plot is about the greed that totally corrupts the amoral. The ringleader is a wealthy rancher (De Niro as Willam Hale) who has no oil on his property. Unfortunately, he wants it all and has the cunning of a villain from Game of Thrones. Encouraging his nephew (DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart) and others to murder innocent Native Americans for their inheritance.Here is a study of arrogance and deviousness. Acting as a friend of the Osage while plotting their murder by violence and poison. And, Ernest Burkhart tried to kill his own wife (the mother of his children). Was he a stupid man, or a weak man?",negative
857,"Watching this movie was no less than a journey. I couldn't complete it in 1 sitting, I took 3 days to finish it. And needless to say, it was worth it. Yes, I agree for a movie this is a long one. But I don't think any editing or removal of segments would have kep the impact equal to what it has as of now. The brutality of human nature, the greed for money and the nature of love are all shown here. The philosophy this movie follows is one to be pondered about.The actors did a great job in there scenes. Brandan Fraser's had select scenes but in them he was absolutely wonderful with his act. Then there was acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, they were just too good to be believable on screen together.This movie is like an orchestra that sounds beautiful because everyone does their part right. From actors' acting to director's directing, everyone fits here like a perfect screw. It was brutal and beautiful.",negative
858,"Under the masterful direction of Martin Scorsese comes another classic. At 3 hours 26 minutes it does tax your patience and gets dreary at places but the overall impression one gets is of having sat through riveting and realistic cinema. The narrative unfolds superbly helped with the astounding cinematography with focuses on grey shades matching the characters' moods most of the times. Enacting out the well etched characters, Scorcese presents his favourite actors Robert De Niro and Leonard Di Caprio in a way that their fans would be delighted. Their fabulously nuanced acting out of the multilayered characters will surely fetch them awards. For that matter Scorsese and Lily Gladstone also are equally deserving of awards.It is clearly apparent that the 3 main actors Robert, Leo and Lily have gotten under the the skin of their characters and are therefore exceedingly convincing. The greed, the desperation, the moral dilemma, the scheming, the sinister outlook, the cold bloodedness , the politics, the sickness, the treachery, the brutal murders, the investigation etc are all so real and totally convincing. Scorsese takes us through all this in his typical story telling style. Scorsese emerges as the "" Auteur "" par excellence with his signature treatment of a true story with grey characters, tracking shots, well executed scenes, moody photography, and the Bobby- Leo combo. I agree with Spielberg when he he says that ""Scorsese is a master of the medium and this is his masterpiece.""",negative
859,"'Killers of the Flower Moon' is not a wonderful movie, that's a quality movie, long enough like most Scorsese's works to imbue you thoroughly with its story and screenplay and in this case, for me as well as many viewers, to teach invaluable historical lessons and facts on the Osage people, their beautiful Native American culture and especially the mere and tough gritty facts, firsthand, surrounding the Osage Indians murders in the 1910s-30s (1921-1926, the period representation story-wise in the film).You will sometimes wish to watch it at ""lightning"" speeds, just to keep up with your mood, valuable time and most of all your nerves, 3h19min of a runtime is insane, making you probably doze off a few times, awaken just to loud conversations and dynamite bangs, but if you could possibly succeed through it without your mind wandering away in wonderland, you'll be gratified by the end.For me, it was this and that, forgot my caffeine ""pills"", though managed through it in the end to comprehend enough and be satisfied by it !To tell you the truth, I didn't like the show-like percussion ending and I respect 'Killers of the Flower Moon' for its beautiful photography, way-above-expectation development and the appreciated historical information that I got from it in a superb quality-entertainment way.Lily Gladstone (Mollie) deserves awards cause she personified artistically and beautifully her character.

860,"Very long and detailed story, did not have the patience to watch at one shot.But its deliberate pacing demands patience. Scorsese's direction and the stellar cast shine, yet the lengthy runtime may test your endurance. If you're willing to invest time in a meticulous exploration of a dark chapter in history, the film delivers, but it's not for those seeking quick thrills.The narrative, based on David Grann's non-fiction book, meticulously explores the sinister conspiracy surrounding the Osage Indian murders during the 1920s. The slow burn is deliberate, allowing the audience to absorb the complexities of the plot, characters, and historical context.",negative
861,"Extremely long and predictable, this film has so many flaws & failed to provide any sort of excitement for me. Mollie was the only character I really was invested in. I am a huge Leo fan as well but he is sort of an afterthought in this film. I forget the actors name who played the detective towards the end, but sheeesh, could you be any more bland of a character? So confused why this movie has such a great review score? Don't waste your time & wait for it to come out on streaming. Any movie over three hours needs to be broken up into a series or something, although i imagine that if it did everyone would stop watching after the first episode.",negative
862,It's very long. It's 3 hours. I am not sure why it needed to be 3 hours. The dialogue is very heavy and the shooting scenes are long and some are repetitive sequences like the strange psychedelic one of men in the oil fields with hammers....It's got classic over-acting and De Niro is shouting a lot. It's got a lot of angst and character pushing their bodyweight around.Lots of frenzied character plots. The characeter devlopment is exceptional but it could have been cut a little.When Ernest Burkhart finally realises William Hale's true brutality his life becomes unbearably dark. It's a dark movie and it's a very bleak picture for the Indian tribe where they are raped by the white man to get money.It's a sad outcome but a worthy story to tell as we must never forget the Indian heritage of America and modern America owns so much to them. I'm glad that this story has been perserved on the big screen as a reminder to the white man and me as a white man that I have to do better in society.It's a very good film but a bit too long and somtimes a bit dull. It's a strong 8/10 as the acting is mesmerising. Leonardo Di Caprio works so well with Martin Scorcese and it's a real treat seeing Bob De Niro act so evil and so well for his advancing years.Long may the team continue.,negative
863,"Killers of the Moon"" caters to a demanding audience, with a penchant for technically sound films and a willingness to exercise patience.Scorsese masterfully creates a pure drama that stands out for its naturalistic portrayal, continuous flow, and a departure from his previous works. Notably, there is an absence of illogical content and the detailed camera angles offer a rich tapestry of information, enhancing immersion. The meticulously chosen locations and costumes contribute to the film's realism. Leonardo DiCaprio, in his usual style, gives a convincing performance, presenting his character, Ernest Burkhart, through different facial expressions. However, it is Robert De Niro who steals the show with an excellent performance by William Hale, characterized by impeccable body language and impeccable dialogue. Lily Gladstone's excellent performance as Mollie, an Osage Indian, is truly commendable and adds a unique dimension to the narrative. A standout appearance comes from this year's Best Actor, Brendan Fraser, as Lawyer W. S. Hamilton, leaving a strong impact on history. The supporting cast also delivers solid performances. The combination of DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone is a visual treat and they complement each other effectively. ""Killers of the Moon"" offers a rich cinematic experience, especially for those who appreciate exceptional acting. Martin Scorsese skillfully simplifies the plot, offering clarity about Osage Indian culture and rituals, making the narrative feel genuine. This masterpiece of crime drama is a testament to Scorsese's storytelling skill.As a fan of the cinematic trio, the length of the film is no problem, and ""Killers of the Moon"" appears as a new masterpiece in their illustrious career.But naturally only those who have read the book will understand 100% of the film, the rest is history.",negative
864,"Martin Scorsese was renowned best friends with the legendary film critic Roger Ebert; and I thought what would Roger think of Killers of the Flower Moon if he lived to see it? Well I reckon he might have echoed everyone who's praised the film for its story, casting and cinematography but criticised the three-and-a-half-hour (intermission-less) runtime. But that last point would be relatively moot for the film itself, and Roger would still give it 4/4 stars, not out of obligation to Martin, but because the film is a full-bodied Western steeped in real-world history and giving equal depth to the Native Americans and the Whites (unlike some other Westerns past where things were more black and white) all against a story of fortune, conspiracy, love and it's many paradoxes.Killers of the Flower Moon is based off the book of the same name, and it took some time to get this film made; Paramount bought the distribution rights only for Apple TV to take over, and then Paramount DOUBLED-DOWN and gave the film a wide theatrical release, and having it debut on Apple TV+ later; and the film is an R-rated $200-million historical epic. And Scorsese's last film The Irishman was a Netflix exclusive with a limited global theatrical run beforehand; and it was still eligible for Oscar Nominations (which it got a lot). Killers of the Flower Moon feels like it's getting the kind of wide release everyone (box office analysts really) expected The Irishman to get in 2019. And in typical Scorsese fashion, it looks like he's made ANOTHER modern classic!Is there anything Martin Scorsese can't do with these lengthy crime epics? Maybe he COULD trim out some of the 'fat' that people have been complaining about, but everything on display here serves the story in a relevant way and shows America's oil-industry history is anything but rose-tinted glory; it was just as lively AND dirty as The Old West, even with the more modern 1920s sensibilities in full swing.Martin Scorsese treats his films like wineries treat their drinks: he makes sure everything is aged just well enough that every aspect of the wine complements itself to make for a strong experience that's bound to stay with you long after you've come home to think about what you took part in and felt.Killers of the Flower Moon is certainly a lengthy movie (an intermission wouldn't have killed the studios to put in, right?) but it's justified in the historical epic factor in that the story is too damn much for an under-two-hour feature to cover, and it takes its time instead of rushing things for the sake of 'modernised' pacing.Killers of the Flower Moon is a 5/5 star experience. 10/10 IMDb points. And EASILY one of 2023's greatest films! Give it a shot (at the cinema or on Apple TV when it comes out there). 4/4 stars too (for you, Roger).",negative
865,"First of all, we must say that this work is entirely owned by Scorsese himself; A great movie that even ignores a novel (the same name of the movie itself); It has all the elements of Scorsese's films, such as camera movement and long shots, cold lights, long shot sequences, gangsters and expedient heroes, mirrors that reveal secrets (where the FBI agent takes the characters hand in hand in the murders of 1931), Catholic religious icons like all the works such as The Straits of Terror or Good Comrades as well as Raging Bull, a strong interest in cinema and its history (showing the films of the attack on black people in Tulsa, Oklahoma) And the narrators who were relatively less talkative in this film, and most importantly, believable and of course strong women, from Cate Blanchett in the Aviator and Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver to Lily Goldstone in the same film, but the genre in which this film is narrated It is possible that it is something that we have expected from Scorsese all our lives, that is, Western, in each sequence you will be asked the question why he came to this genre so late when he is so proficient in it; Another point is about the casting of the film. I see De Niro's income, which he may have portrayed many years ago in his youth in The Adopted Father Part 2 or the movie Good Friends; The powerful game that makes the hair stand on end, he goes through the path of an expedient old man to the main antagonist of the story very well; His limp walking, staring eyes, and even his reference to the Bible or the Torah is more like a slap from the devil than giving you a dry feeling. Lily Goldstone is unique in this film, although she is red-skinned, but The subtleties and performance of a traditional red-skinned woman play beautifully, DiCaprio, in a word, appeared as efficient as ever...
About the movie itself, I must say that I really did not expect this freshness and freshness from the beginning of the movie with a good rhythm music and depicting the Osage story to the editing of the masterpiece, masterpiece, masterpiece of Thelma Schwinger who ends everything in her name; Of course, there is a criticism of the cinematography, and that is that more eye-catching pictures were expected from Rodriguez Prieto, of course, these pictures will satisfy you, but not to the extent of a lasting work of the great Scorsese.In the end, I must say that if you love crime movies, this movie is recommended, if you love romantic movies, this movie is recommended, if you love contemporary history movies, this movie is recommended. In the end, if you love cinema, this movie is recommended. Becomes; Do not let the opportunity slip
Recommendation: Bring some snacks to watch because it's a three and a half hour movie and you might get hungry ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…",negative
866,"Giving this an 8/10 ratingIt's a long film, but like Oppenheimer, it goes by fast, and it's up for best film for sure. Martin Scorsese really has delivered on a great film. The story itself is quite disturbing as it's based on the book of what happened at the time, and of course it's all about greed, power and money- oil money.Lots of American Indians deaths are the main focus of the picture and how the FBI gets involved. Leonardo DiCaprio was put on weight for this role, looks very unhealthy as his his character, Robert De Niro starts of as charming and innocent, as the time goes by, you soon see just how he really pulls of this role, he totally eats the screen, as does Lily Gladstone, for sure is up for best actress, she's that good.More films about the Native Americans and more actors from them are much needed, and they need to as good as this, not rubbish like the superbly bad 'War Pony', which I gave 1/10. There must be more good content from these good people in America, I hope we get it now.Another must see for this 2023 in the cinema, just don't drink or eat a lot before hand, the screen time is long and you don't want to miss anything.",negative
867,"Nothing in this film could hook me. Killers of the flower moon is a film that tries so hard to be ambitious, and complex, and tell a large-story, without ever caring to be interesting. It tries so hard to be real that it forgets to be interesting. This is my main problem.Things just happen. People just talk. Camera stands still. No facial expressions. No cries, No laughs, not any emotions are in sight. This is simply plain boring cinema. DO SOMETHING! Move, cut, show emotions, be alive, make your characters and your world feel alive, the camera should be it's own character but it's not. And all of the things I mentioned were very well made by Martin Scorsese in the past. He lost his touch as a director, he lost what made him great. His characters were interesting and all different, in Killers, all feel the same. They're not interesting enough.My main problem is that it is almost like a documentary. But it's not the job of a film to tell a historical story accurate, it's the job to do it as accurate as it can be in an interesting matter. This is cinema. Give your own spin into it.I could've listened to a podcast and it would've been the same. Compare this to Nolan's Magnificent Cinematic Oppenheimer and it ultimately falls down the elevator into ground zero, while Oppenheimer is at ground 10. In other words, it's a piece of non-interesting information clustered together in an even more uninteresting context.It does not work. It is old-fashioned cinema. The kind of cinema that I believe, we do not need anymore. We need a new wave of artists, that tell more twisted and complex stories that dare to say something bold or critical, without simply just showing what once was. These times are over and have no huge effect on a viewer anymore, me especially. Give your own twist into the plot.",negative
868,"This is a movie that deserves to be seen as it covers a time in history that isn't really discussed much. The cinematography and editing is as great as you expect and DiCaprio, De Niro, and Lily Gladstone are phenomenal and carry every scene. For being a 3.5hr movie the pacing never lets up and every scene earns its place in the runtime. The violence is very appropriate and isn't over the top. The movie does focus on some of the non-native characters a bit much at some points but the film never forgets its message. I'm not a fan of how the movie ends and I feel like it could have been a bit more satisfying after the long runtime but it doesn't ruin the movie. Not in my top Scorsese films but it's still great!",negative
869,"This film is worth watching. Could it have been shorter in running time? Yes. Could it have been a 3-part mini-series? Yes.To us, the biggest deficit of this film is the casting. Hard to imagine that high-powered actors like Robert DeNiro would be wrongly cast in this film - but in this instance, Robert DeNiro plays Robert DeNiro - it is hard to see him as anyone other than Robert De Niro.Leonard DiCaprio starts to morph into a believable character over time - but this film is the first time where all we see is Robert DeNiro and Leonard Di Caprio playing a part.We think lesser-known characters would have been better to tell this story rather than Martin Scorsese's usual limited pool of acting talent.Watch it to learn about this seriously dark chapter of American history.",negative
870,"Scorsese gave us another masterpiece.It's long, very long but I didn't get bored. I loved the atmosphere, and the pace as the story unfolds.It's tragic and sad in general but on the other hand, it's genuine and authentic. The music is also perfect.9 stars because it's long, hard to find enough time to watch it at once. Sitting for 3.5 hours is quite hard.Di Caprio's acting is superb. As much as I hated him in his early years the much I love his talent now.De Niro is just as perfect as always. His play is always causing me goosebumps.Gladstone was totally new for me but she's great. She made me feel her frustration and grief at many points of the plot. I'm also a father so certain scenes are also shocking for me.Such a great movie.",negative
871,"It is likely that a film theorist has a thesis that Flowers fits into a Scorsese oeuvre of American crime stories such that its part of a Goodfellas and Casino arc. It may seem improbable but it is not without justification insofar as Flowers is also the story of male friendship and loyalty just as the two mafia movies were, and let's not forget, Mean Streets too. It is a theme that Scorsese has turned over and over for 50 years.But, as with The Irishman, the running time is contentious. In the future, when most of the participants in this film are long gone, this movie maybe considered a late great achievement by its director. It is that but for the duration which taxes the attention, and in a world of shorter attention time spans, tests viewer commitment on one condition, that is: If it had many twist and turns it might not seem as long as it is, but once the story is set in motion the unraveling goes along at a steady pace - like a novel actually - and although more events are added, nothing like a plot twist adds shock and surprise. It is this which adds to the sense of excess duration. Alternative formats are questionable but there is no obvious fault in the writing in the direction so we have a product which will inevitably viewed in distinct sessions rather than in a single sitting.Having got that out of the way, the movie is strong, and if ever the phrase the banality of evil applied it is to the two protagonists, who are opportunistic greedy psychopaths. The De Niro and DiCaprio performances are as good as ever and opposite each other play well. Supporting roles are effective but there is a cameo effect where some are short, they fill in the necessary plotting; the visit to Washington for instance - though that is an unavoidable trade-off for this type of movie.Production design, the look and feel is compelling as is the photography adding the period. The historical story is the core and it does have enough to it to keep the interest, even if a break is required at times.",negative
872,"Wow even the great Martin Scorsese can't make a good flick anymore now you know film is going down the toilet.People will praise this turd just because Marty's involved.Where to start?

Or Leo's heavy over acting gotta say he's losing his touch, looking rough as well.

873,"I watched ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" on opening weekend at the IMAX screen. This film effectively made me feel as if I were in remote Oklahoma in the 1920s. DiCaprio, De Niro, and the other top-tier Hollywood stars kept me interested and engaged throughout the long three and a half-hour movie.The Osage people were portrayed as proud, stoic, smart, and capable. Although very wealthy, they did not seem nearly as materialistic or financially greedy as the ever-increasing settlers. In the movie, the Osage were skeptical and aware of their situation, yet in the end, they were overly trusting and resigned to their fate.De Niro masterfully pulled off his role as William Hale, a seemingly noble and caring figure. Behind the facade, he used his charisma, power, and influence to manipulate everything for his own greedy purposes. I was left frustrated by the actions and choices of DiCaprio's character, Ernest Burkhart.I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in Native American history. That said, I did not feel entertained or satisfied when I left the theater, as I did with Scorsese's other classics. I understand the film is based on actual events, so in that way, it was very effectively done. The movie was very dark, sad, and depressing.",negative
874,"I just came out of the movie and I wanted to write a review right away. Unfortunately, the movie lasts 3.5 hours due to unnecessary lengthening. The costumes and set design were incredibly good. Di Caprio gave his best performance since ""The Revenant"". I can't say the same for Gladstone, he looked like a theater actor. De Niro is just De Niro. There were many continuity problems in the movie. In the scene where Ernest and Mollie first meet, she covers her ears because of the noise in the street. When the camera angle changes, we see that his ears are open. The camera angle changes again and the ears are closed again. A similar situation is present during Ernest and John's conversation in the street. As the camera angle changes, we see Di Capri's hand on and off his waist. And many more in the field. The movie shows how worthless the lives of others are when self-interest and money are involved. I would have liked Ernest, who says in the movie that he is a Catholic and believes in the Bible, to understand what ""thou shalt not kill"" means.",negative

Not just because it's a brutal period piece expose a very forgotten tragedy in history, but because its message will never not be relevant.Honestly you just have to go see it to understand.

The story is new, but it does not differ from the world of gangs, as we are accustomed to from the director. The world is different, but the dialogue is of high quality, the story is familiar with all the characters, and the plot of the story and narration of the characters and story is moderate. The film is no less good than previous films.

The amount of injustice, violence, grief and pain that's been happening for all those years is hurting me to the bone. The movie was painful, yet important to be shown to teach those unaware about these crimes against these beautiful tribes, we could have learned so much from. However I feel that casting Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert de Niro, took away the spiritual depth and authenticity of the movie and story. Even though I personally like LDC and RDN it just gives the movie this Hollywood glow, which you really would have liked to avoid, considering the importance and necessity of telling this story in the most credible way. Lily Gladstone was amazing and inspiring and really carries the spiritual ancestry of the Indian people, she really makes you feel that spirit. All the others of the cast were great too btw.

It's a beautiful, beautiful movie visually, it's imersive of Osage culture and it's important to shed a light of the injustice the Osage people suffered. All acting is great, but Gladstone's and DeNiro's performances were another level. It made me want to research more about it. The visuals, the soundtrack, the acting, the attention to historical coeherence, all of it. It's more than 3 hours long but it doesn't feel like it at all and I wished they had made it longer (be in a mini-series format).

Their own family members betrayed, poisoned, and sold their beliefs for money. Those were not just killings; they were part of a well-planned genocide.What did the Osage do? What were their crimes?What justified the amount of pain and agony they would have to bear for the rest of their lives?Is it because their lands had oil beneath them?Is it because they warmly welcomed Men from other non-native cultures to join their ranks and populace?Is it because their skin colours were different?My heart goes out to each one of the individuals for the incomprehensible tragedies that have befallen them; I only pray that every single person who has participated in inflicting pain on these innocent people suffers immensely in excruciating misery as long as they breathe, and that they rot in afterlife.Now, from a non-literary standpoint, this was quite well written and well paced. For a film with a length of over two hundred minutes, it felt like a gentle breeze.The amazing performances must also be commended; every member of the cast did exceptionally well, but I have to specifically highlight Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart; the way she delivers her lines, the graceful demeanour with which she carries herself is a treat to watch!It was tough to match up to the brilliance of DiCaprio and De Niro in key roles, let alone leave your own mark, but Ms. Gladstone made it happen, and she deserves all the love and praise.",negative

A masterpiece that I personally not only learned a lot from, but I would also like to thank Martin Scorsese for the smooth path he has leveled for us successors.An initially calm character develops into a monster that the viewer doesn't hate, but somehow understands, yet condemns, was probably one of the great challenges of the movie.The acting is unique, expressing a lot with just a few words, creating a new character that hides a lot of content was probably another challenge in this movie.David Sexta

884,"In the plus side, important amatory and brilliant acting from DeNiro and Gladstone, especially the latter who was mesmerising.The film was fundamentally let down by not being capable of delivering the central premise - that DiCaprio's character was thicker than pig excrement. The actor, editor and director bare responsibility.After 3hrs 29m they were so far from telling the whole story that they introduced a rather ill-judged reenactment of a 1950s theatre 'show' to tell the rest in a toe-curling fashion - including a white man talking in an indigenous American accent, which almost finished me of, before Scorsese's cameo did!",positive
885,"Killers of the Flower Moon is probably Scorsese's most passionate movie. You can really feel the attention to detail and accuracy to the actual historic events while watching. The acting from Leo and De Niro are great. Especially De Niro, genuinely kept forgetting it was him, felt like a completely different person and differed a lot from how he's usually cast.I will say that the length of this movie isn't justified at all. REALLY could've been trimmed down, this story could've been told just as good or better in two and a half hours, or maybe even shorter. The length didn't add anything to the experience either. In Scorsese's other films such as the Irishman and Casino, it adds to the experience since those stories are much larger scale and told throughout decades of time. There's a reason to it. In Killers of the Flower Moon it feels unnecessary, especially since some scenes don't add anything to the plot and a lot of it is immensely repetitive.I also found the music to be rather repetitive. At first I really liked the score and the tension it brought to scenes. However two hours in, the same score, which is only like three notes or something, is still droning on in the background every scene and it gets rather annoying. If there was more to it, or if it like changed, like maybe got more tense as the film progressed, that would've been cool. But no, it's just the same few notes constantly in the background, which made this film drag a bit more.The end really sold me on what it was going for and how much Scorsese cared about the film and what he was doing. I just wish it did more, especially with that over three hours runtime.",positive
886,"I saw this on opening night and couldn't write a review until now. You'll see people talk about the running time , whether it's an issue or not for them (for me it wasn't an issue), but it's the length that contains a lot to unpack in deciding how to honestly rate. Could things have been cut out? Sure. What would I cut out? I'm not sure I would have cut anything. I would have to watch it again and really take note. Nothing stood out that didn't need to be there. Anytime I try to think of a negative, it becomes a positive that works in this film.In the day and age where you can stream a show that lasts several hours, there tends to be a lot of filler. I can easily point to things that can be cut. Watching Killers of the Flower Moon, I constantly felt like the movie was one or two steps ahead of me and was very well paced, not allowing me to be bored. The editing and writing help give the audience clues to what's going on. We ask ourselves what shots or lines of dialogue mean, then the film answers those questions soon thereafter. All the actors are on the same page how they hold back their emotions. Most of the emotions that need to be expressed are expressed internally, just like the characters hold back a lot of their plans and goals. The villains outwardly don't seem bad. They almost appear to everyone else as good people. Eventually circumstances and some botched activities catch up to them by the end.I really wanted to give this a 10 and had a hard time finding things to bring it down to a 9. Ultimately it came down to some things not being ""perfect"". Perhaps it needed 4 hours to fully flesh out some of the characters back stories and aspirations of why they're doing what they're doing. Perhaps that's fine for this film. Maybe it doesn't need to be an edge of your seat thrill ride. Its easygoing nature makes it stand out, maybe for some to give it a 9. Yesterday or tomorrow it could be a 9 for me, but today it's a 10.",positive
887,"Wanted to see it in the theater but the living room worked pretty well. This movie deserves plenty of praise/award nominations for numerous categories like the amazing acting - Leonardo deserves an award, and so does the set design, the costumes were incredible, the amazing soundtrack, and the astonishing cinematography! The only complaint I'd have is how slow some of it is yet the long length was worth it. The story was told, and the authenticity was spot on. Martin is a legend in filmmaking, it's crazy how he's around the same age as Robert De Niro. I'm not sure about any hate or average ratings except people being bored some of the time plus a lot of it was sad yet a true story that is definitely worthy of awards!",positive
888,"I give the film a 7 stars for action, 10 for artistic implementation and 10+ for moral importance. It could have been cut 1 hour, not rhat it felt I sat in the theatre for 3.5 hours but too many scens of Molly sweating in the bed and too little of Tom White, the FBI chief agent and too little of the trial.The movie stayed with me and I will probably watch it a second time which hasn't happened ever in my long life. Incredible how old Robert de Niro has become, watched a clip from Taxi driver on YouTube. DiCaprio overplays the mouth thing. The Indians are all beautiful, I love their stoicism.I highly recommend reading more about the complicated story. Why wasn't Hale and Ernest hanged, only life sentenced and Ernest out after only 10 years and Hale after 20 years. Why; because they only killed Indians.The deeper meaning of the story is to show the American people's true soul. They all want to impose their will on other peoples. And have all of us non-american and non-white incompetents be subdued, robbed and impoverished by fullbloded white guardians.",positive
889,"Based on the book that was centered around the Osage Nation murders in Oklahama in 1920s, the story narrates how one greedy white man orchestrates the brutal murders of the innocent Osage, in order to grab their wealth which came out of the oil business. The racial hatred towards the Indians and the lack of respect for their lives while an entire family is targeted by earning their complete trust. Will the wolves dressed as sheep, on the hunt be caught and justice is served, forms rest of the story.Martin Scorsese has chosen a brutal story to narrate and with a terrific screenplay, he aces the narration. With his usual Uber talented starcast, what stood out is how authentic the time period is and the way the tragic story is set around a couple, Ernest Burkhart and Mollie Burkhart. There is no remorse while the unhinged King Hale orders the hits so casually. Following that with the plight of the clueless family that has to face back to back tragedies was a masterstroke.For it's lengthy runtime of 3.5 hrs, the final act is totally worth it with the interrogation scenes and the only minor complaint is that I wanted the court room scenes to have been extended just to give Brendan Fraser more screen time. Since the source material is not non-fiction, Martin Scorsese does a terrific job in doing justice to the story, firmly aided by strong performances. Overall, it definitely ranks among the finest films ever made and I would strongly recommend this to everyone.",positive
890,"First of all, the film is far too long and could do with at least an hour cut out and what did they spend 200 million dollars on? Vintage vehicles, old town sets and extras? Does that figure include the 30 million paid to Di Caprio? That's now two fat, bloated movies Scorsese has made in a row for streaming services and I think it's about time he retired. He is far too over-rated a director, yes he's made some really good films (Goodfella's) but mainly he has made crap - The Departed, Shutter Island, Cape Fear - This film needed a hero, a good guy as the main character, and not the two despicable characters played by De Niro & DiCaprio. The real characters they play in the film were extremely nasty scumbags in real life and they make the film very depressing to watch. De Niro plays it the only way he knows and if you squint your eyes he could easily be playing a New York gangster.The best thing about the film is Lily Gladstone who plays DiCaprio's wife Mollie. In the first part of the film she is an absolute joy to watch, but as the film drags on and as she is slowly poisoned she doesn't get to do much but act listless. Cara Jade Myers who plays Anna-Mollie's sister, does a great job in a big, brash, fun part. And there is a very moving speech at the opening of the film by Paul Red Eagle - played by Everett Waller. So watch the first 50 minutes for those acting performances I've just mentioned, then turn it off.The last part of the film is about when the FBI come to town to investigate the killings and there follows boring scenes of suspects being questioned until they mention a name and that person comes in for a boring interview and on and on it goes.A week ago I watched a film starring Ben Kingsley-now there is an actor who does not play himself every time unlike De Niro & DiCaprio (Gandhi & Sexy Beast for example) The film is called Jules and it's about an alien who crashlands in Ben's backyard. There's a bit of a ropey start but by the end, I'd been entertained and enchanted. A lovely little film made on a small budget, yet it is 50 times better than Scorsese's unwieldy turd and yet it hardly made a stir, unlike 'Killer Moon' where we have so-called professional critics bleating about how great it is. Apart from the native American actors I've mentioned and the film crew 'Killer Moon' does not deserve any Oscars.I have written this review having watched 2 hours 40 minutes of the film- and I cannot bring myself to watch anymore, life is too short.",positive
891,"Killers of the Flower Moon is another enormous endeavour from Martin Scorsese.He adapted this powerful story of America's revolting treatment of the Osage Nation, through a masterful screenplay and phenomenal acting that sucks you into early 20th-century America from the get-go, never letting up once despite its colossal runtime. While the length is most definitely felt, (at 206 minutes long it's one of the longest films ever) and Scorsese probably shouldÂ´ve made a 30 minute shorter theatrical version, in order to provide a tighter cinema experience. But I fully understand his desicion to keep the full length because every moment is full of startling historical truths, that'll leave you cold, both physically and emotionally by the time the credits roll.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers another oscar-worthy perfomance, his range is simply astonishing, Robert De Niro is going to rival RDJ for Best Supporting Actor this year and the supporting cast, mainly Jesse Plemons, Brendan Fraser and Cara Jade Myers, are all wonderful. But it is Lily Gladstone who is the knockout here. Her performance as Mollie Burkhart is masterful, she's astounding, quietly delivering a devastating performance that swept me off my feet. Killers of the Flower Moon is not Scorseses best cinematic achievement, but it may be his most important one. A true powerhouse of storytelling with ever sequence building upon the last, creating a transfixing experience from beginning to end. The Osage people deserve to have their story told. A truly haunting epic.",positive
892,"A powerful and insightful look at systematic corruption that happened a hundred years ago in United States towards indigenous people (Native Americans) to steal their money and land.America needs more and more films like this that depicts the atrocities that lots of white people do to indigenous people in the history.We should see and examine such horrific acts to be able to act and judge better about contemporary conflicts that are going on. Learning from history is absolutely important.It's a Martin Scorsese film so you can pretty much be sure that it's a very professional film. Professionalism is something that you can see in every single minute of this film. Everything is so crafted, worked and beautifully done.Production values are extraordinary. Art direction and colour grading was fantastic.Rodrigo Prieto did a great job. He's a great cinematographer.Robbie Robertson's score was exceptional and made the film more appealing. There were just a few moments that I did't quiet agree with that particular piece.Casting was flawless and everyone did their positions very good, maybe not perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio put a lot of energy on this role to make it happen.Screenplay was rich and insightful, it was based on David Grann's book and adapted by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese. Eric Roth is great.If you ask me about the runtime, I would say, yeah I think it's a bit longer than it should be and I could cut some of the scenes out of the final version without harming the plot but it shouldn't cause us to completely deny the power of the film and its values.8/10.",positive
893,"Certainly one of the most anticipated films of 2023 for all film fans was Killers of The Flower Moon by Martin Scorsese. This is one of those directors who always manage to generate curiosity in his projects and once again he doesn't disappoint us. The film is wonderful and has a thought-provoking narrative that addresses very important themes. However, even though the story seems to flow in a pleasant way for a long time, the execution of the final act seems a little tiring until it finally reaches the grand finale. Even though this moment is below the rest, it doesn't affect the overall experience, which is fantastic. There is no doubt that this is one of the best films of 2023.",positive
894,"My only criticism is that it was far too long. I watched it in the cinemas yesterday afternoon. But this movie was amazing, the acting, direction, production design and the story was spot on.Leo was amazing as the lead character I was shocked that he was involved with the murder gang that recklessly killed so many people in cold blood.De Niro's performance was incredible, a no nonsense civil detective who is trying to track down who killed Molly's family.And lastly Lily Gladstone, amazing performance totally Oscar worthy, she hit it out of the park she was a woman who went through so much her life and you have so much sympathy for her. Well the woman was married to the man in the murder gang who was involved in the deaths of multiple people.As I say again this movie needs to be 1 hour shorter.But amazing film overall.",positive

The wonderful writing that contains the best elements of writing and the story, which contains many meanings of life and wisdom, and the themes that were discussed in the very wonderful story, which is described only as legendary, and the characters that you will quickly become attached to, love, and even adore. The most prominent of them are De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio, the actress of the character Molly, and many wonderful characters such as Blackie and others. The film and the world, which was very beautiful and in line with the events and story, and the Wessaj tribe, the whole film was centered on them and how they suffered and were oppressed by them because of their obscene wealth. Truly, the film deserves an Oscar and with all its merit.",neutral
896,"Although there's a lot happening during the movie, it feit like there wasn't. The story was too long imo. Could have been told in 1 max 2 hours instead. Wouldnt recommend watching this movie after a busy week, or you'll experience a hard time keeping your eyes open.That said, the story itself was good, which wa about the harsh, brutal history of the Indian people and how they were treated and banned by white people.Leo and Robert had okayish roles, but I mostly wondered what was the added value of leonardo's fake teeth to the movie.I found it mostly a long sit and personally I am not a fan of this genre and type of film, where there is little action and mostly a drawn-out story.",neutral
897,"Another must watch movie from 2023 and another hit from Martin Scorsese. Currently it holds 10 nominations to the 96th Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Best Actress, Supporting Actor, Cinematography, Editing, Production Design, Costume Design, Original Score, Best Original Song).It is based on the 2017 nonfiction book ""Killers of the Flower Moon""
by David Grann, that basically investigate the Osage Indian Nation that occurred between 1920 and 1930. Just as an outline oil was discovered on Osage lands in the end of 1800, but with the boom of automobile industry it value boomed, making the Osage people one of the most rich on Earth at that time, even if the jurisdictions of the legal rights were done by white man. Based on legal attributions and heritage marriage occurring on that time a wide spread of sordid murders and interracial marriages between Indian woman and white men occurred putting a whole af the money in white mens blood dirty hands.Of course being a 3 and a half hour project (after all not all stories can be condensed on 2 hours, and the rhythm is right), the second of Scorsese after 2019's ""The Irishman"" - the movie (which had the rights buyed in 2015 by 5M) was to start production in 2019, but obviously it halted because of COVID what gave Scorsese time to get the money for a USD 200M production (by Apple and Paramount) and started the works in 2021.I will not enter in details of the characters here, but all is historically researched, and many details were affected by Osage contributions. On the Acting part, Leonardo DiCaprio, as Ernest Burkhart, Robert De Niro as William King Hale, Ernest's uncle and Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart, Ernest's wife are just perfect.The nominations of Cinematography (Rodrigo Prieto - Argo, The Irishman, Brokeback Mountain among other sublime works), editing (Thelma Schoonmaker), Production Design (Jack Fisk and Adam Willis), Costume Design (Jacqueline West), Best Original Score (using musics from Indians and from that time, in a discrete, but at the same time prominent in the last work of Robbie Robertson) are all spot one.Maybe the best achievement of the movie is bringing to the spotlights another history side of the evil side of USA, as Tulsa was in the same age.I expect a lot of Awards for this ones, even with some strong competition - and give this one a 9,2 out of 10,0 / A score. Do yourself a favor and see it, if you like Scorsese epics.",neutral
898,"""Martin Scorsese has done it again, creating a compelling and profoundly true story that I believe carries immense weight and importance. There will be those who won't enjoy this movie due to its slow pace and lengthy runtime of 3 hours and 30 minutes. I recommend watching it with your family in comfortable reclining chairs because it's quite a long sit. The film, as my mom described, maintains a consistent tone throughout, which is an interesting approach as the story unfolds.Martin Scorsese even makes a cameo appearance at the start and end of the movie, which is a touching and heartfelt touch. Once again, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro deliver outstanding performances, portraying characters that are both intriguing and compelling, yet with undertones of their characters' menacing actions in exploiting Native Americans who were here before us. The characters are convincing and believable, leaving you reflecting on the importance of diversity and inclusion in a deep, menacing, yet powerful way.Martin Scorsese's passion and heart are palpable in this film, unlike some of his recent projects. It's evident that he strongly felt about this project. As I mentioned earlier, the movie takes its time, unraveling at its own slow, monotonous pace, but it remains compelling throughout. It effectively portrays the greed and hostility that Native Americans had to endure.Before I saw this movie, I heard from other reviews that it was incredibly violent and gruesome to watch, but that wasn't the case. While there are a few violent scenes, they aren't overly graphic. This is an important story, but it certainly won't appeal to everyone. Several people left the theater while we were watching, and some commented on its perceived boredom as they left.I recommend this movie if you're willing to invest 3 hours in a story filled with truth, integrity, justice, and injustice all woven together. If you don't mind a slow-paced movie and are interested in a deep, thought-provoking narrative, you'll love it. However, if you prefer fast-paced action, it may not be your cup of tea.That being said, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' has an essential message that needs to be heard. It demonstrates a lot of heart in conveying its integral messages through the backdrop of bloodshed and grief suffered by the Native tribes who came before us. I hope this review encourages people to watch it and give it a chance, without being swayed by the opinions of others. It holds significant importance and is a story worth taking the time to absorb and appreciate for its crucial messages to humanity as a whole.""",neutral
899,"POSITIVES:1) Robert DeNiro and Lily Gladstone are both completely incredible in this film. De Niro gives his best performance in years while Gladstone will have skyrocketed her career through this performance
2) All of the technical aspects of this film are absolutely fantastic. The direction, cinematography, editing, score and sound are all flawless and spearheaded by Scorsese who is clearly the master of his craft
3) The themes of this film, capitalist greed and how destructive this can be, are themes which Scorsese has certainly grappled with before, but he does it so successfully that it hooks you in every timeNEGATIVES:1) I love Leonardo DiCaprio, but dare I say I think he's miscast here. He comes into his own a lot more during some of the really tense moments in the final act, but for most of the film I just didn't believe him as the character. I think it's because DiCaprio is usually such a strong leading man so it felt unbelievable to watch him play this idiotic character
2) The first act and the final act are both sublime, but the second act felt incredibly slow and baggy. This is the part of the film where half an hour could easily be shaved off in order to bring the runtime to a much more acceptable 3 hours. I felt myself growing tired during the final half hour of the film even though I was really enjoying what I was watching and that is because the middle of the film is so slow.",neutral
900,"I saw Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" yesterday. I was not aware of the story of the Osage's plight until I heard about this movie several months ago. For those of you unaware of the story, the Osage Native Americans in Oklahoma were living in poverty until oil was discovered on their land. Wisely, the chiefs insisted on keeping mineral rights when the reservation was created. Unfortunately, white landowners in the area were not very happy and they schemed to acquire the rights via deception and murder. The Osage base inheritance rights via the female side, so that is where we see DiCaprio and De Niro come into the picture to steal those oil rights. DiCaprio plays a doughboy who returns to live with his uncle played by De Niro. Soon, DiCaprio meets and marries an Osage woman (brilliantly portrayed by the relatively unknown Lily Gladstone). DiCaprio is excellent as a man torn between love for his wife and his children (it appears to be at least partially genuine) versus his greed and loyalty to his uncle. De Niro is great as usual as DiCaprio's uncle; he brilliantly conveys an unctuous charm that covers up a truly evil personality whose greed and potential for violence knows no bounds. Eventually, the federal government becomes concerned and sends the Bureau of Investigation (the predecessor of the FBI) to investigate the murders. Jesse Plemmons plays the chief investigator with aplomb. There are all too brief appearances by Brendan Fraser as a prosecutor and John Lithgow as a defense attorney who are also great. The movie is brilliantly filmed by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and excellently scored by the late Robbie Robertson, so the film comes highly recommended at 9/10. My reasons for deducting a point are that both DiCaprio and De Niro are bit too old for their characters and there is an unnecessary, campy epilogue using a fictional radio program to explain what happened to the real characters when simple captions would have been fine.Some additional notes: in the trailer, when DiCaprio picks up Gladstone's character for the first time, she says something in Osage. DiCaprio says, ""I don't know what you said, but it must have been Indian for 'handsome devil'""! This was unscripted and Gladstone's giggle is genuine! As for mineral rights, I know of some real examples in Pennsylvania where a mining or gas company kept the mineral rights, but the homeowner didn't know that. The companies dug up their ground and there was nothing the homeowner could do about it, so be careful!",neutral
901,"There aren't many films that can earn a 3.5 hour runtime, but this was absolutely one of them. From the first shot to the last shot (both of which were unsurprisingly breathtaking), there was no doubt that Scorcese had made another movie about more than just the events themselves. It's about the compromises we have each made, as individuals and as a society. It's about the power (and money) we seek at all costs. It's about the violence we tolerate. It's about what we're willing to admit, to others and ourselves, when all is said and done. Scorcese has been a master for a long time, but I think he offers more empathy and perspective here than ever before. This movie may not be as electric or thrilling as others he's made, but there's something deeper. Maybe he found that something in this story or in Osage country, but i think it changed him. And it changed me too.",neutral
902,"Scorcese seems to have more and more problems with telling a story and its ramifications in a comprehensible and entertaining way. That was the case with The Irishman and it's the same in this movie. Following the killers is also exhausting, the storylines are often only poorly connected, and DiCaprio with his protruding lower jaw looks like a ridiculous Brando copy on the Godfather. Well, and DeNiro is once again parodying himself. The film's narrative weaknesses are most evident in its excessive length. When editing the film, Scorcese clearly couldn't decide between the important and the unimportant.",neutral
903,"The movie is utterly tragic. It is a real eye opener for those unfamiliar with how the west has pillaged indigenous communities, even those who had ""western"" rights & assets. Sadly, its also a great insight into how poorly human beings can behave, and how greedy we can be.The length is necessary as you need to really understand the context, backstory and circumstance of these characters and it allows for a gradual yet captivating build up to a wonderful (and only possible) ending.Hilarious how many people scored this down because of its length. Wonder what they think of the Godfather? Its definitely not for those with a limited attention span.The performances are remarkable. De Niro & Gladstone are outstanding. They carry the movie for me. Leo's character is meant to be a handsome dimwit, and he executes this well, though at times hes too ""charasmatic"", for a dimwit. Plemons is excellent.",neutral
904,I'm not going to bury the lead. Killers of the Flower Moon is crazy good. It's the frontrunner for this year's Best Picture Oscar.Lilly Gladstone's performance as Molly is riveting... She keeps this movie centered and credible in a way that few actresses could ever match.DeNiro is a different kind of villain. He plays William King Hale as an entitled manipulative Patriarch who thinks his selfish desires for power and his covetous need to obtain the wealth of others serves the greater good of his community.Hale's chosen instrument to steal anothers fortune is his charming but dimwitted and obsequious nephew Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio).King Hale sets his nephew to woo the heart of Osage Indian Molly (played by Lilly Gladstone). Lilly is the daughter of a family who's property was one of the fortunate acreages blessed with rich deposits of Oklahoma oil. Discovered early in the 1900sMolly is a wealthy woman. But she also has sister's who will inherit part of her mother's wealth - But King Hale is playing the long game and that puts Molly's entire family in danger.Scorsese uses the first ten plus minutes of this 3:30 minute film as a prelude explaining how the Osage tribe came to live in Oklahoma and how the oil that was found there put the people in Jeopardy.Like most of Scorsese's movies this story is about greed and corruption and it involves gangsters. The gangsters here are not the smooth thieves of the big cities. The hard men in service to DeNiro and DiCaprio are as dangerous as they are inept. Frontier men who have principles they adhere to but will make murderous exceptions when it comes to members of Oklahoma Indians.The Osage are aware they are being hunted for their wealth but they cannot fathom that man they consider a great white uncle has anything to do with their plight.Scorsese's film personalizes the larger story of the Tribe through Molly's eyes.I've given much away in this review. So let me wrap this up by lauding the actors involved.De Niro is as solid and evil as he's ever performed. Yet you wonder if his King Hale thinks he is truly doing evil.Jason Isbell and Sturgill Simpson (Americana musicians of note) both have significant supporting roles; Isbell plays DiCaprio's brother in law his southern drawl exaggerated to make him appear slow witted and dangerous where Sturgill Simpson is plays a sharp outlaw specialization is referring the right bad guys for the wrong job. Simpson in particular is showing a strong appetite for the acting profession.Jesse Plemmons turns in a nuanced portrayal as a lawman. John Lithgow and Brendan Fraser are prosecutor and defense attorney. They are proof that when scorsese calls.... You say yes.DiCaprio's portrayal as Ernest Burkhart is my favorite performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape. DiCaprio character was motivated by greed and avarice was equally tempered by fear and respect for his uncle and a geuine love for his Indian Bride. He should get a nod for best supporting actor pr best actor - It was both a simple and complex character. I'm not his biggest fan - but he's very very good in this.Lilly Gladstone is pitch perfection and holds this sprawling film together. She is a frontrunner for best actress.I loved this movie and will watch it again as soon as it hits Apple TV.,neutral
905,I want to start by saying I read a lot of reviews on here before I watched the film that said the movie was too long and boring. Several reviewers said they fell asleep and they felt it should have been two hours instead of three. The only people who would say that about this movie are people who do not care about what this movie is about and what a horrific injustice it was to Native Americans. These people are wrong and they shouldn't be going to movies that take a deep look into Americas troubling history with Native Americans. They don't want or care to take an interest into what happened to these people.I found the movie incredibly moving and deeply upsetting. It is hard to watch the movie but it is harder to watch it and to know this happened to these people. I highly recommend the movie and I did not find it boring for even a minute. I think it deserved every minute of the three and a half hour runtime it had. Don't listen to the people who said it was boring.. they just can't go that deep or they don't care. Definitely a movie to watch.,neutral
906,"We didn't want to go watch the movie because it is too long, 3.5 hours. Then just taking a stroll, saw daytime sale tickets and figured we'll be done early anyway we went for it, and boy it was a good movie. I didn't expect it to end so fast. I didn't notice 3.5hrs go by. Moreover I thought it wasn't enough time to show all of the story. The actors were awesome, well De Niro and Dicaprio are great actors, everyone knows that, but I've discovered Lily Gladstone being amazing actress. The scenery in the movie is beautiful, all sets are amazing, everything is very well done. After we were discussing it and everyone found something different that looked awesome in the movie. I'd say, go see it if you haven't yet, it's pretty good.",neutral
907,"Since the length of this movie became the main aspect criticized by the critics, that's the first aspect I'll discuss: ""Killers of Flowers Moon"" is long enough to pay respect to so many who suffered because of dehumanized greed and to force us to pay respect to the cinema as an art, fighting the 2.0x culture that transforms all narratives into a waste of our time, as if nothing is important enough to be worth.All the parts of the movie have their value when it comes to constructing complex characters as they were in real life. For example, the first quarter focuses mainly on the aspects of Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and Ernest's (Leonardo DiCaprio) relationship. It might appear dispensable, but without that, we have a story where several Osage women are fooled by white men, which could appear naive on their part. But, knowing the intricate flirting dynamic between Mollie and Ernest, we are presented with the story of intelligent women who are often aware of the truthfulness of their men, but still caught in charming and complicated relationships.I also praise the sensitivity towards the Osage representations, the contributions of the numerous Osage members on the team. It was important so I could better understand the reasons why some characters acted in a specific way. For Lily Gladstone's character, there's a scene teaching us how she deals with a storm while being quiet. So, what could have seemed like passivity in the face of the movie's events, I read as her way to recognize that she was in front of a storm that was much more powerful than her, so she needed to remain calm.The technical aspects are great too, just as is the case with everything Scorsese is involved in. The actors are amazing and really well-directed, especially Lily Gladstone, who perfectly portrays this quiet woman fighting the chaos alone. But the small details I mentioned that make the movie seem so long are actually its greatness and an excellent means to explore the themes of human instability and the devastating destruction of an entire culture. But I wonder: when will we acknowledge that many nations were built on a bloodbath when we are not even willing to dedicate a few hours to watching a movie about it?",positive
908,"Almost done watching the movie at home, paid 19.99 to rent it figured id rather sit at home than a theater for that long
I'm just a regular movie watcher.So far this movie is too long and too confusing. They never say how long time has passed from one death to the next. They translate the Osage language when they want and it just ticks me off that you have no idea what the heck they're saying!!I enjoy watching Scorsese movies and this one and his last one (The Irishmen) were not very good to me.I was not aware of the horrible things done to the Osage Indians and will be reading the book to get a better story from that then this movie.",positive
909,"Yes, this is a long film. If you have an interest in seeing a true story told more or less perfectly by a master of his craft, whatever the runtime is shouldn't be a problem. This isn't television, where you watch an episode or two. This is a movie. A real movie about real people that aren't superheroes or spies or Jedi or cartoon characters. Martin Scorsese has made several movies about gangsters and crime, but somehow ""Killers"" manages to eclipse most of those movies. Maybe because this film is based on a true story that most people don't know anything about. I didn't. Sure, ""GoodFellas"" and ""Wolf of Wall Street"" were also true stories. But both of those films were insider looks at criminals. They're both masterpieces, don't get me wrong. But ""Killers"" somehow cuts deeper. We see these proud, successful Native Americans being murdered for their money. At the center of this pain is Lily Gladstone, in a remarkable performance as an Osage woman whose family and friends are being killed off. Gladstone expresses the pain of these losses perfectly.Equally perfect is Robert De Niro, in one of his best performances in many years. I don't think he has ever played someone so truly vile and evil, yet he never goes into ""Robert De Niro-isms"". He's a nice old man that will stop at nothing to get more money and power, and he's aided by host of lowlifes, including his nephew, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He has the toughest job in the movie, playing a simple man that loves money but also loves his wife and kids.This is not a fun movie on any level. It isn't a movie where you watch lowlife idiots make poor life decisions and you can laugh at their folly. This is a movie about a people that were already nearly wiped out being wiped out even more in a vast criminal enterprise. It has moments that are tragic and genuinely gut wrenching. It's one of the best crime films ever made, up there with the Scorsese films I mentioned above and the first two ""Godfather"" films. But it is exhausting because you find yourself wondering, how much suffering can people take in the name of greed?",positive
910,"If you have time to watch it one long afternoon or evening, I highly recommend it. Soothing and relaxing to watch, it's the perfect way to unwind. The cinematography is exceptional, capturing beautiful moments throughout, and the protagonists are top notch. The love story unfolds against a backdrop that feels contemporary and relatable, making it captivating and meaningful. The film beautifully captures the essence of romance while addressing themes that are pertinent to our lives today. A delightful blend making it a must-watch for those seeking a heartfelt and a thought-provoking cinematic experience.",positive
911,"Martin Scorsese has done a great job again. It was a better movie than ""The Irishman."". The movie is long. Too long. That is one of the reasons it is difficult to watch, and it is not a movie that should be watched repeatedly. The majority of people prefer not to watch it again. It's not that it's not a good movie; some movies are very good, but they are often not preferred to be watched again. The movie is based on a true story. I felt sad again after reading the facts about what happened. First and foremost, Martin did an excellent job of directing. Rodrigo Prieto did a great job with the cinematography. The cinematography of this movie is very good, and the color tone is very good. In addition, congratulations to Telma Schoonmaker. Despite being a three-and-a-half-hour film, I enjoyed it. Both the script and the production design are excellent. In terms of music, Robbie Robertson did not exaggerate. Epic music was not preferred in this movie, but I think this is a good idea. The acting is excellent. Everyone played their roles very well. Everyone is so good that it seems like Leonardo di Caprio did the weakest acting among them. I think Leo is usually very prominent in movies and is very charismatic. But this is not the case in this movie; he plays someone who is a little dumb and always subject to manipulation. His way of speaking and his teeth were a bit strange. Lily Gladstone is the star of this movie, and Robert de Niro was great too. The other guest actors also did their jobs very well. There are a few things I didn't like about this movie. First of all, I think the owl scenes and scenes from the other world (heaven) were very unnecessary, these scenes spoiled the seriousness of the drama of the film. Additionally, there are a few scenes in the movie where people speak in the local language, but they do not show us what is being said, even with subtitles. This was not good. Except for these two things, there was nothing else I didn't like.",positive
912,"This movie is one of the most perfect films that I ever watched. Killers of the Flower Moon is a Movie about the Osage Nation, one of the Richest Native American groups who was the victim of the murder. This is the First time that Martin Scorsese made Western Movies; many people know that He Made a Gangster Film. But no, this movie is one of the films since Goodfellas. At the End of the film, they can show Scorsese Cameos and I love that this film depicted the Harsh Reality of the American Dream. I love that The Killer of the Flower Moon should Watch The Best Picture again after the Departed in 2006.",positive
913,"My rating speaks to my opinion. This film is not only important for its historical accuracy, it is absolutely riveting (particularly, for those of bored by absurd action films). For those baffled by or disappointed, that Ernest's character is not fully who they expect or want him to be - wake up, people can be baffling and disappointing.There appears to be a great many complaints about the length of the film. I saw nothing that should have been left on the cutting room floor.Yes, I would have been grateful for an intermission but I blame exhibitors & distributors for this. Certainly, for films of this length, the 15 to 20 minutes of trailers before could be shown instead during an intermission, in consideration of viewers bladders.",positive
914,"There must be some people really into the history of the storyline on the reviews here because this was painfully slow to watch. It's the first movie I've ever watched at the cinema where people half left half way through. I'm afraid to say nothing happens in 3.5 hours at all...The acting is well done, but that isn't enough for me to tell you to watch it. You're forever waiting for the interesting bits, and they just never appear. You're also waiting to see if a story develops which will keep you guessing, but it's fairly obvious what is going on from the first minute.All I can say is watch something else unless you already know the storyline and really want to watch the history of it play out.",positive
915,"My favourite movie so far this year. No question about it. Amazing in every single way, especially the acting. Really all the major actors were amazing. On top of that the story is truly gripping and emotional. The only major criticism I can think of is that it is maybe a tad bit too long. No matter how good the story is, sitting down in a theatre for 3,5h is always hard. Some parts towards the third act could maybe have been cut down a little bit. However I can also understand why not. At the end of the day it is still a 3h+ movie. Perhaps this kind of story is better told in a miniseries of somewhere around 3-4 episodes.",positive
916,"To start with, yes the movie is 206 minutes.But it never lost the momentum in those 206 minutes. The movie flows with a rhythm which has become a kind of a trademark of Martin Scorsese. And the background music plays a big part in maintaining overall rhythm of the movie. With Killers of the flower moon too, the score is great,(well you expect a great background score in Scorsese movies anyways).The best part for me was the crooked side of the whites and the soft ways of the Indians shown with such careful consideration that you tend to appreciate the 3 and half hour story line without it being a minute of off track or boring.The performances for the lead roles were impeccable with lily gladstone matching the exceptional delivery of dicaprio. Robert De niro too delivered a great performance.If you are someone looking for a great storyline with an even better overall delivery by the director, you will not be disappointed.",positive
917,"I will be watching it again!This was my first opportunity to go to the theatre to watch this incredible film, and I am very happy that the opportunity had presented itself, because who knows how long it will take Apple to put it on its streaming service, even though it says, ""coming soon."" I wasn't about to take that chance and perhaps wait for months, before seeing Leonardo, Scorsese, et al, do their thing and entertain and inform me at the same time.The film is absolutely brilliant, with a stellar supporting cast, which did its absolute best to suspend my disbelief, which is what makes a film great, in my opinion. If there is an academy award ceremony for this year, the only other film I can think of that could possibly snatch any winning nominations away from this film, would be Joaquin Phoenix and Napoleon. I'm looking forward to seeing his performance, because Leonardo has the Oscar on lock, if Joaquin doesn't take it from him. I am so excited for this film and whatever else DiCaprio and Scorsese will do together. I mustn't forget to mention, that Lily Gladstone is a superb revelation in this film.She needs to be in all the things: just an absolutely stunning performance!",positive
918,"This movie is the best definition of the ""Wolf in sheep's clothing"" Hiding malicious intent with kindness.Lily Gladstone delivers the best female performance Ive ever seen.Triumphant, in every sense of the word. Seamlessly blends that classic Scorsese crime drama with a harrowing romance to create something bold and. Profoundly tragic.There isn't a single wasted minute, every frame has purpose. Avarice, violence, betrayal- it's all here and portrayed with a deep respect for the Osage people. At times it feels I'm watching career bests from everyone on the screen, but undoubtedly Gladstone is who shines the brightest, chewing the scenery of every frame.There's been a lot of discussion about the runtime (painful discussion, to be clear). A great piece of art is only as long as it needs to be, and this is precisely that. It flew past, and honestly...I could've sat for another 3 hours on top. Take this review with a grain of salt because it seems tailor-made for me, but I believe this is the best film of the year so far.",positive
919,"Takes time,might feel drag but bear with it Scorsese will gift you with tears at the end and it is worth every dime. Leo like everytime in a Scorsese collab gave a performance which is something to be witnessed. With De niro it was just a treat a gift from the filmmaker to all the lovers of cinema and if you ara a Scorsese fan it will be a treat. Leo will give a hard time to Cillian Murpy in the best actor's race. Leo's performance was enough for me to make me seat through 3hrs 20mins. Its classic Scorsese movie we expected or maybe more than we expected. Go watch it on a big screen and see what a real cinema feels like.",positive
920,"While the subject matter is phenomenal (in the most gut wrenching way), I came away from the movie almost hating it. Especially the way it disrespected my time as a viewer. A 3.5 hour film that could've easily been 1.5-2 hours and much better for it.By the middle of the movie, I had no feeling of tension or ""what might happen next"" magic. The last half limps along just as the shiny setting and subject matter lose their novelty. Scorsese is known for bombasticCast is excellent on paper but doesn't work at all. Again, Scorsese fell into the trap of actors playing characters dozens of years younger than they should be. Leo is cast as a lazy moron who's supposed to be being manipulated by his uncle as he so obviously plots to murder an entire Native American family for their estate. I guess he was supposed to add moral ambiguity to what was going on but it just didn't work. The movie would've been way more interesting told from the perspective of Mollie/Osage family and Leo as the lead FBI agent. De Niro was a bright spot but only relatively speaking. His attempt at a western/rural American accent was dismal and extremely immersion breaking.In all, if you have 3.5 hours to spare watch Oppenheimer instead, or hell The Irishman for that matter. Film is a total failure in my opinion.",positive
921,"Martin Scorsese has a more than established position of mastery in film making so it's almost pointless to state the obvious, production design, set, direction and sound track all amazing as expected.There is however a common criticism for Scorsese latest films while obvious it doesn't harm to mention again; it's indeed too long for what it needs to be, the story could've easily been told with the exact same impact with one hour less, I am not sure why the need to extend it for 3 and a half hours.Let me mention the positive aspects of the film aside from the things I stated in the beginning; terrific job by the main protagonists, De Niro and DiCaprio deliver master class performances and Lily Gladstone was at their same level with a heartbreaking and intense depiction of her character, I was really surprised and felt incredibly drawn to her character's charismatic personality, at least in the early parts of the film.Another great aspect of the production than can't be left unsaid is the fact that Scorsese worked very closely with the Osage community, not only he sought out their advice but also employed several folks from the community as actors and for other aspects of the movie production and of course by depicting such story it allows for a conversation to be started globally and nationally, I am not American but from what I read even within the US this story is not a widespread one so it's of the highest importance to make sure indigenous people get their stories told so that the horrible things in the past serve as a lesson for how society should move forward.With all if that being said I felt the movie was a bit underwhelming and the story and plot overall for me are weak, I mean it's a Scorsese type of movie but this time is based on a real life tragedy so it feels a bit out of touch.I didn't feel that there was enough focus on the indigenous people they wasted too much time in the evil plans of the killers drifting away from what could've been a great indigenous perspective movie. There were many scenes that felt way too long and also I felt there were many aspects and scenes that were a bit too goofy given the subject it touches I felt personally that it could've been a great movie for the shock effect given how horrific the events that took place were for the natives. I felt it was a lost opportunity so I don't think this movie deserves the ""masterpiece"" category regardless of who made it it doesn't do justice to the natives.It's a great conversation starter and I hope diversity continues to be on top of mind.",positive
922,"I've been simmering on this one for a while because it is certainly a lot to take in. A film that is so colossal and thematically rich, and despite being 206 minutes long I would happily go experience this again on an IMAX screen.I don't want to sell this as like an educational movie, but I do think it is legitimately IMPORTANT for people to go see this in a theatre. It's so rare to see a major studio give 200 million dollars to, in my opinion, the greatest living filmmaker for a film that really tells us something about who we are as a society and how we got to where we are now.There are so few filmmakers able to do what Scorsese can; taking a film with subject matter as dark as this and having it be constantly enrapturing. Robbie Robertson's (sadly final) score is so crucial to the success of the film, as the film goes along it feels as if the score is charting Scorsese's musical history; going from stones inflected crime tales to orchestral treatises on North America's historic sins. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stunning stuff; it's never flashy but always so well considered and almost painterly. Prieto to me is the linear successor to Michael Ballhaus in terms of the great Scorsese cinematographers. I of course have to mention that Thelma Schoonmaker is probably the greatest living film editor, and her work on this film is so impressive. She's the one making this near four hour epic feel so well paced.There are so few filmmakers able to do what Scorsese can; taking a film with subject matter as dark as this and having it be constantly enrapturing.

923,"What to say about this one and not to praise and just praise mastery of Scorsese!Its a history lesson with so much depth and dynamic.Marty plays with everything he knows and have, mix of genres, art of storytelling, pace... everything!Touches lil bit of development of everything that is bad about making of America.Simply instantly classic.Acting and directing is on a levels that even Martin go beyond his abilities, great actors developed more for him, but at the end it's everything from Marty.Scorsese can now easily go and rest, he made everything and his legacy is forever.I enjoyed cinematography alot, few shots just blew my mind how well directed and executed.",positive
924,"This is the 18th Martin Scorsese movie I've seen. And it settles firmly into the upper quartile of this remarkable director's work.His range is immense and this sits closer to some of his American History documentaries than it does to, say, Gangs of New York or Wolf of Wall Street.But it actually has its roots in Casino/Goodfellas territory, because it's a kind of mafia film too in that it explores a very one sided gang attitude to clansmanship (and in a small part Klansmanship).It's actually a story of genocide/ethnic cleansing, as Robert Di Niro's (rarely better certainly not in the last 40 years) rich, ranch-owning, Oklahoman one-man dynasty sets out to wrestle away the oilfield rights of the Osage tribe of Native Americans by hook or by crook - mainly by crook.The Osage are mightily rich because oil has been found slap bang in the middle of their land and Di Niro's William Hale is jealous and determined to get his greedy mitts on the money.He does this in a pincer movement. Firstly by marrying his returning WWI war hero, a dim-witted nephew Ernest Burkhart (phenomenal played by Leonardo DiCaprio) into the Osage. His willing wife Mollie (a star turn by Lily Gladstone) is unaware of Hale and Burkhart's long term ambitions and simply falls in love with him. Truth is, it's mutual.Hale's second strategy in this pincer is the straightforward murders of Mollie's family and many more Osage besides. There are numerous cold blooded killings that pepper the movie and yet it never feels gratuitous (cold blooded and shocking, yes, but not especially repellent - like it might have been in Tarantino's hands.)It's a study in racism and of greed but that doesn't mean Di Niro, DiCaprio and Gladstone don't win you over with their overwhelmingly great performances - expect all three to feature at next year's Oscars (I expect Di Niro to pick up his 9th nomination, DiCaprio his 8th and Gladstone her first - maybe a first ever Oscar for a woman of Native American descent?)Gladstone is a silent but steely presence. Much of the film documents her suffering at the hands of Hale and Burkhart, and it's truly shocking how DiCaprio treats her, despite his undoubted love for her.It's widely documented that the film is extraordinarily long (3h26mins without a break is a bladder challenging sit through) but although it is features murders galore it's no action picture. Do not go looking for any Marvel escapades in this one folks. But it's manageable, riveting and entirely justified in its length.One other thing to point out. The soundtrack is an almost imperceptible blues bass thrum by Robbie Robertson that builds tension at an almost inaudible level but is like a heartbeat throughout. Sinister and compelling it quietly drives the story along. Bravo Robbie.The movie is a savage insight into a part of American history that was not familiar to me and it deserves to be seen by a wide audience. Judging from the low availability of seats in Edinburgh's cinemas this weekend that ambition at least appears to be coming to fruition.Go see.",positive
925,"This film is excellent. I normally don't enjoy film adaptations of books. But this is one of the exceptions. It deviates from the mystery/detective focus of the novel and takes a more human focus on the events and never loses sight of the horrific injustices done to the Osage people. It's absolutely chilling.The acting is top notch. Excellent cinematography. There is not much of a soundtrack. Many scenes have no music at all. The editing is excellent. It clocks in at over 3 hours, but the film really breezes by due to the incredible editing. There was really only one scene that felt like it was dragging some. For the most part, it genuinely captured my attention.",positive
926,"Marty's worried about superhero movies killing cinema and he's actually killing us with boredom. This isn't a movie I'll ever have a desire to see again and I checked my watch at least 3x praying for it to end. What a waste of a story. They stopped talking about the oil after the first act. Nothing happened. People died and life went on. It was just a drag to get through and I LOVE long films. I saw Oppenheimer 4x, Avatar TWOW 3x, and they went by in a breeze.I don't think the 10/10 reviews on here are real. This is a 5/10 max with tons of wasted potential that was 90 mins too long. Hang it up Marty.",positive
927,"Is it a must-watch? Absolutely! But...Iconic? Definitely! This movie will age well. I believe we can expect a good number of memes and funny reels. Haha, but...So why not a 10/10? Well, if you're a Western geek, don't expect too much. I truly think it's one of the best Hollywood movies since the lockdown. However, I really enjoyed it once I forgot it's a Western. Because in that regard, it lacks iconic soundtracks, chase scenes, and gunfire. The very first scene and the last sequence were a little boring.BUT overall, an extraordinary performance by Leo. Robert De Niro was Robert De Niro (although I wished for more screen time for the big man), but the chemistry between both of them was great!",positive
928,"This is a great western crime drama and a great movie in general. But it is not an instant classic or one of the best Scorsese movies.The movie has a killer cast (pun intended). The whole cast really shines, bur Leo takes it to another level again. A completely different role for him, this time around. His character is a somewhat stupid, naive and a very pliable, but still a character with a lot of different motivation and emotions.I must also give praise to Lily Gladstone, exceptional acting.The story is different then anything I ever watched and introduces the viewers with a part of american history very rarely shown on tv or any kind of screen. I don't want to spoil anything. But be prepared for an interesting and tragic real story.The filmography and production are top notch. The world feels grounded and real. Only average part of production is the music, which is not bad, but a bit to same-y and not enough emonitonal for the story unfolding.As for the direction. There is a couple of problems:
The pacing, the duration and the ending.The pacing is just off. When you feel the movie should go faster, it goes slow, when you think it's about to end it starts a new story.It's hard to find a bad scene, or scene that should be cut out, because of the great acting and interesting story in general, but overall I beliave lthat less is more, would be apllicable here. The movie could have ended earlier with a bigger emotional hit, or could have been shorter and still tell the story it intended.The ending is told, not by the actors in the rich world we were watching for and a half hours, but instead in a play in front of an audience. I don't understand this choice because for me this was a really immersion killer.To sum up. A really great movie with an interesting story, stellar cast and acting. But the duration, pacing problems, average music and weak ending, stop it from being a classic in my eyes.",positive
929,"'Killers of the Flower Moon' is just an amazing film! It gave me a deeper understanding of a part of history I knew very little about.Lily Gladstone gave a really fantastic performance, particularly later in the film after a lot of the darker events had occurred in the narrative! For such a large cast, I honestly cannot say that there was any bad performance.There were many examples of excellent cinematography and editing. In particular, the epilogue sequence was superb and very memorable. Furthermore, it is impressive how this film gives an incredibly detailed depiction of the Osage Nation in this time period. Scenes are filled with fantastic costumes, props, and film characters. This is a must-see of 2023!",positive
930,"Killers of the Flower MoonThis epic western crime saga recounts the tale of the Osage people in 1920, whose newfound wealth from oil discovery on their land brought both prosperity and a wave of violence and death.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" presents a grim examination of how individuals, driven by greed and cowardice, can commit heinous acts. Ernest Burkhart witnesses his uncle's ruthless killings of the Osage people for their wealth and becomes complicit in these atrocities. As the violence seeps into his own home, he remains indifferent, even contemplating ending his wife's life despite his love for her.Despite its lengthy runtime of three and a half hours, the film maintains tight pacing throughout. While it delves deep into the lives of the Osage people, it also explores the broader circumstances surrounding them, offering a comprehensive view of the events that shaped their lives.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a fully committed portrayal of his character; Ernest embodies both heartlessness and cowardice with chilling authenticity. Robert De Niro, true to form, delivers a stellar performance. Lily Gladstone's portrayal of Mollie stands out as one of the 'daintiest' performances I've witnessed. Despite her character, Mollie, not delivering monologues or extravagant expressions, her gentle demeanor exudes life and commands attention effortlessly. She serves as a brilliant representation of the positive values inherent in her tribe.Martin Scorsese's direction is immersive, and atmospheric, and demands patience from the audience. With meticulous detail, he resurrects a forgotten incident, shedding light on it with painstaking care.While ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" may pose a challenge due to its lengthy runtime, for those willing to weather the storm, it offers a blend of education and entertainment.8/10.",positive
931,"Once again Scorsese has given us a masterpiece of cinema. It is great to finally see a released movie that tells a story well and without a bombardment of special effects.....yes you Marvel. The story of the Osage Count finding oil and its people becoming rich leading onto murder was told without hesitation meaning as real as possible. Some scenes are confronting but bearable comparing to what is seen even on television. Once again De Niro and DiCaprio produce stand out performances and are deserving of an award respectively. Could the story have been told in a shorter amount of time, yes but admittingly it sustained attention well into the movie prior to first look of the time. My only negative opinion, after having watched 3.5 hours, the end seemed rushed. Finishing the story via narration rather than continuing the acting which I would have preferred. Overall consider watching the movie for both its entertainment and education.",positive
932,"I watched this movie hoping I would learn a little bit more about the Native American people - who were there first. But after three and a half hours I know almost nothing more than when I went in. It's a totally wasted opportunity.I also don't care; everyone in the film is awful or passive. No one is doing the right thing and there is no hero, just a weasel.Not a single really cool shot, nothing we haven't seen before. Where is the cinematic edge? It's just lots of big sets with lots of costumes. No cinema.What is new in this film? What is there that hasn't been done before, and the answer is nothing.Yawn.",positive
933,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a very good movie that is driven by the experience and chemistry of Scorcese, DiCaprio, and Di Nero as the director uses his signature charm to tell a captivating story about a dark time in American history, but its unnecessarily long runtime really brings the movie down from being something truly great.Great Direction (Scorsese shows why he is a real master of story-telling as he steps away from his very overt style of telling the story in favor of one that is emotionally driven (yet it is still very obvious that he is the architect of this movie because it still has his signature charm); really gets the most out of his actors as he uses them as components to convey emotion; gets everything done on both a macro and a micro level; could have chosen a tighter cut as the elongated scenes (which can be argued helped with showing the characters' emotions) dragged the movie down and made it feel a lot slower), Very Good Acting (Great from Leonardo DiCaprio (Gives a real emotionally driven performance as you both empathize yet despise him at the same time, he shows why he is the best in the world as he plays the line between anger and sadness effortlessly), Great from Robert De Niro (Really shows his experience in this role as he uses his signature charm and chemistry with Scorsese to be a real menacing presence in every scene he is in), Very Good to Great from Lily Gladstone (The real emotional compass of the movie as you feel for her throughout the film; she holds herself well in all the scenes she is in and becomes a central figure for others to work off of; even though her performance is not as dynamic as the DiCaprios and Di Nero's, she still can show so much with so little as her sickness and loss shows what is being taken away from her), Very Good from Jesse Plemons (Holds his own very well and acts as the objective, outside entity looking into the situation), Bad from Brendan Fraser (Just feels very out-of-place and forced; just unnecessarily over-the-top and had no chemistry with any of the other castmates), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast (Really hold their own and show why Scorcese is a master at getting the best out of his actors)), Very Good Great Story (The best part of the film was it was well laid out and entertaining to see the conflict slowly peel layers to see what is truly going on (turning from a mystery to a crime film in true Scorcese fashion); the characters were written very well as you know a lot about the motives and feelings of the native and white characters; the story takes a different turn from the source material and this is a very good choice as it shifts the perspective from the FBI to the Native Americans to show how they are experiencing the conflict; the biggest issue with the story is just how long it is as it could have been cut and still show the same story), Very Good to Great Screenplay (The dialogue is very heavy and well written as the audience is interested in what is being told on screen (though the heavy southern accents really doesn't help with understanding what is going on); there isn't really a 'narrator' like other Scorsese movies but they do use dialogue to help drive the story forward and show what is going on; the symbolism is incredibly present and helps show the impact the crimes have on the Osage and the lengths that greed has on individuals turning away from their morals; foreshadowing is great and helps with keeping the movie interested and well structured), Good to Very Good Score (The use of southern and native motifs helps with setting the scenes; the score is used well in helping build tension), Great Cinematography (Really helps with showing how polished this movie is and helps with making each scene look so captivating), Very Good Sound (Helps with building the tension and scenes (especially the absence of sound at points)), Very Good Editing (Edited very well as there are no major flows (and there are some shots where the editing was so seamless it showed how experienced Scorcese is at making pictures); the actual cut of the movie is long and editing really could've helped with making a bit tighter), Very Good Visual Effects (The use of practical effects helped with conveying the period), Great Production Design (Used both the Western and Osage aspects of the movie to help set the time period), Very Good Costumes (Helped with setting the period and giving the Osage a memorable presence), Plot Structure was a major issue for this movie as it the movie is just too long (the exposition and rising action as just unnecessarily long to the point where the audience is exhausted by the time the climax hits); the movie could've cut 30-40 minutes of the story to really help with making the runtime a lot shorter (and it would still be the same movie and give the same message), Pacing was incredibly slow as there is just so much plot to go through and there are many scenes where there is just open-air (this hurts with helping keep the attention of the audience as the movie just bogs down the further it gets), Climax was well executed and captivating (it is just the audience is so exhausted by the time they get to it, it hurts from captivating what is going on), Tone on the surface is very similar to a mystery with Western elements (but deep inside feels like a Scorcese crime movie), Liked this movie equally as much as I liked 'The Irishman'",positive
934,"Just wanted to add some things that struck me while watching this film. DeCaprio is at the height of his powers. There is a scene where he's being interrogated (no spoilers, promise). The lighting is such that the reflection from Leo's face is eerily reminiscent of Vito Corleone. Simply meticulous work by Scorsese. Martin is part of that cadre of directors that while making film also make art. It's obvious that this story meant something to him. The ending really caused me to see the story and the way it was told in a different way. If you're deciding to put in the time to see this film, give it the chance it deserves.",positive
935,"In 1920, the Osage people of Fairfax, Oklahoma were the wealthiest people per capita on the planet. Why? Because the Osage reservation was situated on a massive oil reservoir, the discovery of which led to this native tribe becoming fantastically wealthy in a fantastically short amount of time. Yet as we all know, the joys of wealth and prosperity are soon followed by the inevitable onslaught of those wanting to claim those joys for themselves. When the Osage people begin to be murdered one-by-one, the weight of the situation falls on the shoulders of Mollie Burkhart, played by Lily Gladstone, who needs to figure out who is killing her people.Martin Scorsese eloquently tells the story of the Flower Moon killers through the viewpoint of an outsider, Ernest Burkhart, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. His performance exemplifies decades of acting experience come to fruition, as DiCaprio flawlessly plays a character that's 20 years younger than himself.Robert De Niro stars as William Hale, a man of power and influence in Fairfax. His on-screen presence is intense, with a sly, comedic nature to it. Many of his quips resulted in outbursts of laughter from the audience, either from the humorous nature of a line or the absurdity of a social situation.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a vast and multilayered story to tell. The film clocks in at 206 minutes, making it longer than both ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Avatar: The Way of Water."" This dialogue-driven movie is highly engaging, if you have the attention span for it. The girl sitting in front of me in the theater scrolling through Instagram on her phone clearly did not.Watching such a lengthy film all in one go was a very memorable experience. I never got up from my seat throughout the whole film, much to the chagrin of my bladder. But I am glad I didn't. Scorsese's masterful storytelling bridges the gap between past and present, giving audiences valuable time to spend with the nuanced and complicated people of the past.The script is clever and intelligent. The cinematography is as adequate as one would expect; the exterior shots of the Oklahoma landscape are often breathtaking on the big screen.Violence is a signature element present in all of Scorsese's work. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" takes the few-but-far-between approach. Don't expect the all-out bloodbath approach as seen in his other films like ""Taxi Driver"" or ""The Departed."" Rather, this movie contains more emotionally driven and scattered killing that works to drive story and character, while still retaining the shock value found in some of Scorsese's other films.""Killers of the Flower Moon"" works as a film because it transports audiences to a different time in America's history. If the story of the Flower Moon killings is not compelling enough, merely viewing this film as a snapshot of life a century ago will make it worthwhile. Times, troubles, and technologies may change, but as movies like this one show us, people remain the same.",positive
936,"For all of those who are saying the film is ""too gruesome"" - that's exactly the point. Scorsese ought to be praised for his bold, unfiltered look into a historical event that, up until now, has received very little spotlight. History is bathed in blood, and this movie is no exemption to that.Scorsese having the actors learn native Osage language adds a layer of authenticity to the story, and it shows just how dedicated he really is to portraying their story accurately. The props and sets are top-notch, including all of the cars from the 1920s that look perfectly preserved in time. I also tip my hat to the costume designers, who did an astounding job on the native Osage clothing, up to and including the intricate tribal weaving/stitching.I, and I assume many others, had no idea such a tragic event had ever occurred until watching this film up on the silver screen. I also deeply appreciated Scorsese's perception on showing his masterpiece in movie theatres - as opposed to just streaming on Apple TV. He demands respect for cinema, and I believe that this film respects cinema, just as everyone who buys a ticket to see this does.Witnessing Di Caprio and De Niro working together was a treat, and through cold, calculated conversations, we see them hatch a plan to slowly eliminate the Osage people in order to get their greedy, corrupt hands on their oil money, or ""headrights"". The real star of this movie is Lily Gladstone - whom portrays Mollie Brown, an Osage native dealing with diabetes, and whom is forced to mourn the deaths of her family all around her, unbeknownst that her husband had a hand to play in all of it.",positive
937,"Veteran Martin Scorsese's epic ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is his most disturbing work since 2016's ""Silence"" in which the soundtrack was absent in favor of screams of pain and agony. Here, a soundtrack exists. Made, in fact, by The Band veteran guitarist Robbie Robertson not to mention a scene near the end in which Blind Willie Johnson hums melancholically as the sun sets on the evil of William K. Hale.Speaking of evil, is its very boldness that is so disturbing. Sure, Scorsese is no stranger at exploring the darkness of macho men who have no restraint when exercising their power, but while his past movies revolved around mobsters who hid their faces and kept as much distance as possible from their victims, in here, the evil is in plain sight, presented as an ally, a friend and a confidant. In one scene, William Hale (Robert De Niro) even bestows a traditional Osage blessing on a sick Indian woman in their native tongue only to then order hits on their community with the same disturbing detachment that can only be compared to the architects of The Holocaust.Sure, some people argue that someone like Scorsese is not adequate to tell the story of a culture he had no part of. He is aware of that, so much so that he allowed the Osage actors--most of them actual members of the Osage community--to improvise freely while filming their inner circle. And then again, this movie is not as different from his older themes anyway as Hale and his nephew Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) act like Mafia bosses and the hits that they make are equally brutal and secretive. The interaction between William and Ernest is nothing like mobsters, though. They are clearly not veterans of mob-like hits, and Ernest--while morally sentient and a First World War war hero, is also too much of a simpleton not to be corrupted and intimidated by his uncle's power.This easily-influenced character brutally tossed around was played flawlessly by DiCaprio who did the best performance of his career. He was brilliantly vulnerable as a fearful, weak man torn between the love he has for his wife and the greed present in his nature. But while we all know DiCaprio is great, the true revelation is Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart, Ernest's wife and the heiress to a great Osage fortune. Very few actors can act simply by existing in a scene and she is one of them. While DiCaprio sunk generously in Ernest's weakness, Mollie displays nothing but pure strength. There is dignity in her eyes, power in her voice and nobility in her struggles. She is a beacon of human resilience in the face of evil. Scorsese gave Gladstone the opportunity to honor her native ancestors, and she did.Throughout the movie, there are mentions of various historical massacres with the notable one being the Tulsa Massacre. This is not a coincidence. Scorsese wanted to get the idea across that these murders are history repeating itself again, shining a light on the pattern of blood and hypocrisy on which America was built and how minorities always got the short end of the stick. In one final disturbing act, the movie focused on the resilience of Hale's evil. Even when facing imprisonment for his crimes, Hale continued to act like he's done good, even writing courteous letters to his Osage ""friends"". His lies ran so deep that I started wondering if he actually believed them himself. Eventually, during the ending, the movie deals with this evil in a very stark dark humor manner akin to a stand-up show.Its running time might be three and a half hours, but ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is perfectly paced and grounded to give weight to its already disturbing darkness which settled itself so cozy into each unseen crevasse of man's heart and soul that is hard to think it could ever be ripped apart without destroying everything alongside it.",positive
938,"There are many sermons from the Indians about the importance of preserving their own tribe and how their women should not marry outside their tribe at the beginning third of the of the movie. But, despite the movie being 3,5 hours long, we don't really see why these Indian women fall for the White men. It just happens.I was bored out of my mind in the first 15 minutes. What are the stakes? What is the story? Why should I care about any of these people? And this is really not a TikTok thing either, you really have to get people engaged right away.DiCaprio and De Niro are not used well. There is no chemistry between DiCaprio and Gladstone (which makes their relationship implausible). When Mollie says ""I don't really know if you love me anymore"", I'm just throwing my arms in the air. Are we just supposed to believe any woman should automatically love a character portrayed by DiCaprio, even if it is not elaborated in any way? This DiCaprio does not have any charisma. I just don't believe it. Or maybe her own tribe's men are just absolutely dreadful? Who knows?Scorsese has really crashed and burned in his later years.""As far as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."".Like, okay, I already get the framing for the story right there.With this movie, nuthin'.However, Scorsese's point about the irreconcilable interests of different ethnic groups is of course a bold statement. And very timely. It just deserves a better movie.",positive
939,"This is a film that appeals to greatness because its story, actors, director, music and technical aspects are great. It is the triumph of the great classic school of auteur cinema where it appeals to a captivating story and performers who convey exactly what the director must transmit. Nobody fails here; from the local cast to the great Scorsese-fetish actors and the magnificent supporting roles. The film has a significant length but nevertheless the experience is satisfactory. It can be argued that there is a bit of exaggeration in Di Caprio and De Niro's classic mannerisms. The indigenous cast is first-class and there is room for surprise, laughter and also indignation. Like any good story, it is composed of greed, betrayal, feeling and tragedy. Great cinema is based on these elements. With three magnificent scenes, it is undoubtedly the best film of the year.",positive
940,"Yesterday I watched ""The Moon Killers,"" and I truly loved it. In my opinion, it's an elite-level film due to several factors:-Visual production: I'm drawn to the Scorsese touch he's been applying lately with ""The Irishman"" and now with this movie. The way the camera moves and the artistic focus with depth in most scenes are very characteristic of his style, and I personally love it.-Characters: Starting with Ernest (Di Caprio), I don't find his character very deep, but Leo manages to create several dimensions seemingly out of nothing. His outstanding interpretation and gestures adds depth to a rather mediocre character from that society, making it very compelling. Not to mention the chemistry between him and De Niro.Rey Hale (De Niro) doesn't seem burdened by his age in the slightest. There's practically nothing more to add about such a professional. His passion for the role is evident, and he pours his soul into the character, portraying the ""villain"" flawlessly.Mollie (Ernest's wife) pleasantly surprised me with the actress's performance. She managed to infuse her character with a touch of mystery and ""self-confidence"" in a very cutting-edge way without losing the essence of having been a victim.Honorable mentions to her sister Anne (the drunkard) ,kelsie and the final cameo as Brendan Fraser's lawyer.-Plot and script: At first glance, it doesn't seem like an attractive plot, but I believe Scorsese used all his experience and quality to craft it into a complete storyline, shedding light on a sad and unjust narrative that went unnoticed by the world.Finally, I found the way the film concluded with the show and his cameo at the end to be bold and original.In conclusion, it's a very good movie worthy of a great and experienced filmmaker like Scorsese. I'd rate it 8.2/10.",positive
941,"I have never read David Grann's novel yet being a film buff and lover of history this film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" I had to see. Legendary director Martin Scorsese and heavyweights DeNiro and Dicaprio made this film a must see for me. Long too as Martin sure goes in depth and in detail with the story and the scenes and cinematography background captured the landscapes of the Oklahoma area just fine. The story set in 1920's Oklahoma the film involves oil and a new booming economy the Osage tribe seem to enjoy life as they have something to live for. Enter the wild card character of the film Ernest Burkhart(Leonardo) who returns home from war and he's taken under the wing by his rich and clever, cunning uncle William Hale(Robert DeNiro) and they have a plan which is motivated by greed as it ties into land and oil, and Ernest is game as he marries into the Osage tribe. Soon secrets, missing Osage members, and murders lead the FBI to get involved. Overall this film is long in depth still it's a showcase of a forgotten time in history, so any film and historian lover will enjoy watching this film.",positive
942,Not a typical Scorsese movie but you can feel decades of movie making experience in this one. Lily Gladstone was best among the three main characters but De Niro's performance was chilling. High marks to editing and score. To make a movie this long and still not feel like its dragging is commendable. You know what will happen next but still want to see it. Pure cinema. This one might pip Oppenheimer for best movie but Cillian is still the front runner. This movie can be put into category of 'There will be Blood' and 'No country for old men' especially when it comes to the score. Overall one of the finest work of Martin Scorsese.,positive
943,"Not a fan of Martin Scorsese but went and watched it after seeing that kick ass Trailer , Starts like a true drama with the Osage people and their culture and the crimes and murders which are all happened to them , Both Decaprio and Robert De Niro killed each and every frame with their performance ( the conversations and the drama was good) and Wife character tooo , Great usage of the music ,it Was louder only in required scenes , Special appreciation for the casting and the overall making , thought 3 and Half hour is a streched out length but it was not like that each and every scene was interesting till the end , Do not miss this one on theatres.",positive
944,"Yesterday I went to the cinema to watch this movie. I was so excited to finally watch it and I would like to say wonderful things about it but it was boring.The movie is so long and It would have been much more interesting if Scorsese hadn't revealed who the killers were and had left this suspense for the end!Seriously I was expecting something different!The saga of the Osage is a tragedy caused by greed: the suspicious deaths of its members (which are, in fact, coldly premeditated murders) begin to happen when their lands turn out to be rich in oil.The movie aim to denounce the oppressive relationship between the United States and indigenous people. In this way, the film is an epic with respectful representation of the Osage people and their culture, while also highlighting the cycles of violence and oppression perpetrated by the white man, his cruelty and greed.",positive
945,"Scorsese never ceases to amaze. It may be 3:20 in length but it doesn't get boring or tedius and most movies of this length do. Scorsese is at his best; DiCaprio does a tremendous job and De Nero, just when I thought he was about through, gives us a possible supporting actor performance. This film runs 3:20 but it doesn't drag or make you look at your watch. It's a wonderful film. So why did I give it a 9? For two reasons. One, I have a problem with subtitles. The are usually in white and on a white background that are tough to read. The second and final problem is making DiCaprio, at the end of the film, look like Brando in The Godfather. They could age him without stuffing his jowls. Other than that, the movie was excellent.",positive
946,"Hey, my first Scorsese movie on here! The film ""Killers Of The Flower Moon"" is an adaptation of the literary work of the same name by David Grann, which recounts the events surrounding the Osage massacre and the establishment of the FBI. This movie is really great with stellar performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and the standouts being Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart and Robert De Niro playing a disturbing villain in William Hale, in which I totally think her and him totally deserve that Oscar nomination.The cinematography is fantastic, with some many cool and jaw dropping shots to look at. The editing is really great in this, with Thelma Schoonmaker making this 3-hour film feel faster and have a smooth pace to it. If I had one complaint, it would be that the movie can drag at some times, with scenes going on a bit too long in my opinion.Killer Of The Flower Moon is a lengthy but also interesting true-crime movie about a massacre that people need to remember and be told about because of it still happening to this very day behind closed doors. Because genocide happening all over the world at this very moment! Movies like this are need now more than ever. With great acting, especially from Lily Gladstone with her bringing this devastating performance as she watches her tribe and family be killed around her slowly with her having no one left except her husband, only for Ernest to backstab her and slowly poison her with insulin since he puts.",positive
947,"My title basically says it all. At 3 hours 26 minutes, this film is good - it's undeniable. But if the film had just cut out bits here and there it would have been a great 3 hour film.There's so many excellent elements here. A great cast, great acting, great characters, a fascinating story, beautiful to look at, a really well-done script. But it does feel that the film re-treads over the same ground multiple times within the first couple of hours. In a way, and I hate to say this, but Scorsese has kind of been given 'too much' freedom. Scorsese needed to make cuts to this film - as the old saying goes, 'you have to kill your darlings'. Cut out half hour, shorten some sequences, I can assure you the film would have been faster paced and told the exact same story without a loss of impact. In fact, I believe it would have been more of an impact to cut it down. Quicker, punchier, to the point, and perhaps would have highlighted the atrociousness of the situation even more.However, as the film is 3 hours 26 minutes, let's actually talk about what the film is then. At the length that it is at, I consider it a rumination - a rumination by Scorsese of America's sins. It's about white greed, gluttony, racism and generally how humanity can be so inhumane to man in the name of money and self-gain. It's a gentle paced story, which is fine but I believe that this particular story in the way it has been told doesn't need or deserve to be gentler paced. But as it is of a gentle pace, Scorsese definitely embraces that. He takes his time on shots and allows for this epic story to be strangely intimate.I was not a fan of The Irishman and it's slow, plodding, (frankly) boring pacing. Here, it works better. But again, as stated, it needs that quicker energy to it I believe.Not Scorsese's best, but I would recommend the film if for nothing else than it's subject matter, fantastic technical achievements and simply wonderful acting.",positive
948,"Whenever Martin Scorsese directs a film, I and most anyone who knows his work expects greatness. He is arguably, the greatest working American director. So expectations for me were very high going into Killers of the Flower Moon. Like is common these days, the film was very hyped and the running time was also given alit of discussion. I have never been a big complainer about running time but some films these days do feel like they run too long. This film is almost 3 and a half hours long and I have to say that as good as this film is it dies feel like it could have used some trimming.The film is based on a true story set in the 1920s where members of the Osage Native American tribe of Osage County, Oklahoma, are murdered after oil is found on their land. The main character is Ernest Burkhart, played by Leonardo DiCaprio in one of his best performances. In 1918, Ernest Burkhart returns from World War I to his rancher uncle William ""King"" Hale, who lives with Ernest's brother Byron on the reservation. Hale is played by Robert DeNiri in his best performances in a very long time. Hale is a well regarded figure in Osage, especially by the members of the Osage tribe. Hale tried to influence Ernest by telling him to get close to Molly Kyle, who's family owns much of the oil land headlights in Osage. Molly is played by Lily Gladstone in a performance that is surely to get a lot of praise. She is the heart of film. Ernest and Molly fall in love and marry but Ernest is working with his uncle the whole time scheming to take advantage of getting the headlights for his uncle from planning the deaths of many in Molly's family.To say that Ernest is likeable it would be an overstatement but Dicaprio plays him with a certain charm and even stupidity that we as an audience don't totally hate him. Scorsese has dealt with evil people in his films many times before but the difference here is that the violence is not as prevalent as his other films. There are so e jarring scenes of violence but what this film has is a real sense of dread. Molly has diabetes and is sick most of the film but us a victim of the scheme to steal from her people. She is a very sympathetic character and if I have a complaint is that I would have liked the film to be told a.littkr more fro.her perspective. Eventually the Osage tribe get the BOI to investigate the murders. The main agent, Tom White is played very well by Jesse Plemons..The film is really not a mystery because we know who is involved in the murders but it is very involving anyway. I would say that the running to e is justified but I would have wanted a little more focus on Molly and her family. Is it a film that you need to invest some time and patience into it? Yes. Is is a little too long? Yes. But is great that there is a filmmaker like Martin Scorsese out there that wants to to tell stories like this.Not quite on the level of some of his masterpieces, but close ...Grade: A-",positive
949,"I saw this movie yesterday with my long-time movie buddy, (a Native American man) after reading the book 2 years or so ago. I'd been anxiously waiting for the movie, and was excited about the cast. After seeing the film, I wish the movie had shown more about the community life of the Osage, though I think Lily Gladstone gave an Oscar-worthy performance in her role as Molly. However, I thought Leo DeCaprio was too old for the role, and (while I usually have thought him to be a great actor...) his portrayal of regret/anger/anxiety was ridiculously limited to the one, down-turned-mouth-face he made for the last hour of the movie or so.It was good to see Tatanka Means as one of the very first FBI agents, though I wonder about the historical accuracy of that. Tantoo Cardinal's acting skill was rather wasted where her character of Lizzy Q., Molly's mother, could have been more in-depth. Because it was a true story about the one-track white man's lust for money over the value of Native lives, it was hard to watch and process. But because it was a true story, it needed to be told. I did not care for the weird ending; I thought there could have been a better way to tie up that tale of betrayal and evil.",positive
950,"The story of anti-Indian terrorism in had so much potential to be a compelling story of a shameful bit of American history, but the director chose to make it yet another film about the internal conflict of a flawed white man. The book it was based on is a superb piece of investigative journalism in a problem that still echoes today - it viewed the issue largely from the eyes of outsiders surprised by the scale of systematized extraction and astounding racism. This viewpoint, that of the Osage nation themselves, and the effects through today were deprioritized despite being the better story.This story could have been told in two hours, with plenty of superfluity left in the final cut. There was surprisingly little dialogue between non-white people for a movie billed as being about a group of them.",positive
951,"Before I started watching Scorsese, most crime movies had a certain cinematic purview that made the crime portrayed in it handled by men different than normal or the said crime totally changing them. When I started seeing Scorsese movies, those people started looking more real. They had more real behaviour with the people around them. Even if they aren't your normal everyday guy, they carry them with a sense that the crimes they do are part of their lives as well as everything else a normal guy does in his life. It was not portrayed as a gimmick for quirkiness as some directors do. The quirky way of showing such things and the more traditional cinematic approach of other directors are also proper ways to tell their stories. But this mix of rawness without losing normalcy and with great cinematic sense at the same time was what made Scorsese films attract me initially, even though obviously there's a lot more to appreciate.But even then, his protagonists always had some kind of idea what was going on which is what narratively makes this film very different from most of his movies for me. This approach itself is very much informed by his realization of being someone outside of Osage looking into it. But the protagonist played by Dicaprio in this film is one of the most innocent yet guilty people you can find in a film. Someone who goes through the motions of a lot of stuff on the advice of others because he thinks that's for the good and considers the evil just part of the world and nothing more. It's fascinating because he is at the same time a perpetrator and a victim in his own story. So, what happens is that the people seem even more real-life normal people here. When Robert Deniro talks even towards the end, it feels like a very normal person making so much sense in everything he's saying while everything he says is manipulation. The normalcy with which that is approached kind of increased the horrificness of everything.So, we never really see the more evil villain say anything that is outright villainish or doesn't make it sound like it is when he says that. The way racism plays out in this movie is something I've only seen in other movies, where people suspect others of doing so but never really end up becoming reality. Most movies show the villains being open about their bigotry at least after a point but here, the villain is always acting reasonable even when he is not actually doing anything reasonable. The way the Osage community was infiltrated by these white people, only to replace them is almost impossible to imagine for someone like me. The way it is systematically broken down so that the inheritance of the natives is slowly moved towards the white people, the patience of lengthening the acts of terror through the years by these seemingly normal people. All these make all those movies where the small group of people are afraid of loving outsiders, a lot more sensible approach.The way Scorses decided to look at the indigenous people with respect but always from a distance worked very well for me. Lily Gladstone was phenomenal. Her role needed her to be subtle and powerful at the same time and she brought it out of her incredibly. Dicaprio had to do something very different from whatever he had done before and did it great as well. The way the camera stays at both of them in many scenes really compels them to take the roles into their souls are reflect that through their eyes.The three and half hour runtime has been utilized very effectively. The way it shows how these not-so-efficient people pull this off because of how the system works. How acting benevolently outside is the only thing needed, for getting out of trouble, when the system is biased and is on your side for you to oppress ""the others."" How this systematically happens is slowly unravelled for us and the painful realization is given the time to settle in to reveal even the so-called justice served is so convoluted that there is no real justice served, nor any real admission of guilt even when there is a recordical one.Again, I really think it was brilliant to choose such a protagonist who does have an ingrained racism in him with incessant greed. But at the same time have straightforward thinking to believe in true love that doesn't have any restrictions and at the same time about a kind of power structure that is rooted in bigotry.",positive
952,"Killers of the Flower Moon presents a story, masterfully and experiencedly narrated by Scorsese, about the deep-seated greed and prejudice that is rooted not only in American history but also in the very essence of human ambition. The film resembles a chess game, driven by avarice and opportunism, where the black pieces consistently play defensively, awaiting the attacks of the white pieces one by one. Even though the outcome of the game is known, the ambiance it creates evokes melancholy and prompts profound contemplation. Much of this sentiment draws inspiration from the classic Westerns and is effectively conveyed through silence.With outstanding performances from both DiCaprio and De Niro, it's worth noting that Lily Gladstone, in particular, delivers an impeccable performance, bringing forth a wealth of genuine emotions. Her portrayal stands as one of the finest in the history of cinema. Through this film, Martin Scorsese, once again, delivers a poignant story, coupled with brilliant cinematography and remarkable performances, allowing us all to grasp the true essence of cinema.",positive
953,"The movie is very long but it is an excellent movie. The story is very interesting and the narration of the movie is even more interesting. Old news footage added a different realism to the film. Maybe it could be Scorsese's last movie. Be sure to watch it in the cinema. A movie of this length cannot be watched on television. Because you will need extra concentration. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting has improved a lot over the years. He reached his peak in this movie. Will he get an Oscar? I think it depends on the other competing films. But there's one thing I know. If Leonardo wins an Oscar for this movie, no one can object.",positive
954,"I'm in awe from Scorsese filmmaking: complexities of the characters, the intricate love-story, the social relevance of the story, the cultural heritage and generational - historical trauma where 'white men' of the 1920-ies have been portrait in their full human nature and excellent acting of all cast.Slow pace and 3,5 hours seemed absolutely doable with such immersive world of incredibly well-made historical costumes.Watching Martin Scorsese himself in the end of the movie reciting the final words of history just underlined the personal significance to the director.What signifies a good filmmaking for me is when we afterwards start asking ourselves the moral questions and reflect upon societal issues.What's a good filmmaking for you?",positive
955,"I was expecting to be bored during its runtime, but I was gripped from start to finish (though I did have to pee twice; stupid soda).I recognize that I am biased, as I live in Oklahoma and am in film school here, but this really is something special. It's raw, grim, and sad. It's a piece of Native American history that I never heard about until the book came out.Lily Gladstone was INCREDIBLE. She was a major catalyst in what made this movie interesting. Leo was fine for most of it, with a few scenes where he did great.Overall a stellar film that I think will be talked about for a long time.",positive
956,"This story is incredibly devastating. It's an important part of American history that I wish I learned about in school. Its a terrible thing, what this country did to the Osage. The book is so good because it's told with the Osage at is center. I hoped this movie would give the story a platform for more people to learn. But instead, Scorsese decided to amplify the voices of the guilty. Also wondering why J. Edgar Hoover was completely left out of the storyline here in the movie? Instead, the FBI is portrayed as the saviors of the story, instead of the real motif of that organization at the time.Lastly. Why oh why is Jack White doing an impersonation of an Osage man at the end? Why not, at the very least, allow actual Osage to finish telling what little of the story the movie left?",positive
957,"This story is amazing. I was expecting another story of massacre to get their territory but this one is about the rich natives being dispossessed more slowly. This is very fitting for Halloween. Like a real life slasher where one of your friend is the serial killer. Here, several are and the poor natives don't know who to trust. The enemy blends with the friends and even with the lovers.This being said, the rendering of the story is also mastered of course. The period and the sets, the costumes are perfect. The acting is top. Leonardo plays the chump under the thumb of his oncle very well. To the point that he is horrified himself.This story also extends very well as a tale of murderous bashing that still happens all over the world. Probably every homogenous group in the world is guitly of it at some point in their history.",positive
958,"This was an absolutely powerful movie, perhaps the most of 2023. It manages to stay true to the book and actual story while still being engaged on the screen. The story is told beautifully and touches on a community of people often ignored in Amefican film. In addition, the film brings true three-dimensional characters who are likeliable while still ultimately finding out that they are serial killers. This story needed to be told but there was no guarantee that it would be told so powerfully and in such a compelling fashion. High praise to the cast and crew, including the cinmetgorphy, the musicians and the costume designers.",positive
959,"That's all I have to say that money is everything was everything and always will be there's like no love in this movie, I had to write this review as all was coming to a pointless victory with no victor but justice that had to be avoided if any of the convicted was smart, and i realized the law is unbreakable from the thoughts and insights derived from this movie i tend to see the game was fun until that thing they call karma or maybe combined with the cries of the deceased coming from the other side
Infact they all connected great drama movie. The drama was epic and off the charts one of the best so far.",positive
960,"Very good performances from both Leo and de Niro .., with a supporting cast of class actors ... music was a fine accompaniment and the visuals excellent .., really got a sense of how it was as the Hordes of ""Americans"" began to descend on the native populations destroying culture, landscape and stealing resources by murder, threats and lies .., nothing much has changed in that respect and it appeared that Scorsese is articulating that sentiment of the USA developed further the same rapacious behaviour of the modern day Barons hand in hand with a corrupt democracy today albeit on nations and continents.",positive
961,"The first part to address is that it certainly has a long runtime. So much so that my local theatre which always has a late show does not offer one for this film. Normally I'm quite against long films as I feel a director should be able to tell their story in 2 hours or less. However , though it still felt long, there were so many interesting elements to this movie. The acting was fantastic. Although Leo was good, for me it was De Niro who really stole the show and I'm usually not the biggest fan of his.On that note, I'm not even a Scorsese fan either and think in general his movies can be a tad dry and dare I say boring. This one had my attention the entire time. The camera shots were engaging, the background music tense, and the costumes and setting were superb. In general it was a fantastic cinematic experience. Although I'm sure the actual story is filled with way more detail that even a 3 hour plus film couldn't cover, the film in my view does the topic justice and should spark the viewer to do their own personal research into these events.",positive
962,"A movie about coming to terms with history, produced in 2023. It tells how the people of America brutally massacred the real owners of the continent for money. But I didn't like the movie. Despite the legendary director and legendary actors, there were shortcomings.In my opinion, I can list the shortcomings as follows.The emotions in the movie were very superficial. A family was massacred, and a woman did not react as she should to her husband, who became a tool of this. There was unnatural acting in many other scenes.Natives are being massacred. Local people are waiting like sheep to see whose turn it will be. No one questions who benefits from these deaths.The movie is extremely long and there is a lot of talking. There is almost no action.Even though the movie is so long, there is a disastrous conclusion that I cannot explain. We already watched the movie patiently to see these results. You read from the last paper. Comedy.And there was no music in the movie that settles in the mind. This is one of the biggest shortcomings.As usual, De Niro doesn't play the role, he lives it. This man is the pinnacle of acting. I think Di Caprio was a little duller than his other films. In my opinion, the film cannot be watched a second time in a different environment.Sexuality and nudity are ignored in the film.",positive
963,"A brilliant portrayal of what lengths corrupt men and oil companies do to attempt to wipe out a peaceful and loving community. A shameful piece of American history that needed to be told with detail and poignant scenes to remind us all that injustice and treachery must be challenged.This movie not only shows what happened to these people - it provides the viewer with a close up view of what these power hungry men did to deceive the Osage people and that community using violent and extreme measures to satisfy their greed for wealth, domination and oil. A persistent issue even now in global affairs.Well done again Martin Scorsese for punching the viewers heart. Worth every minute of viewing. Why not sit back and take in the story over 3 hours plus to come to a closer understanding of the anguish that the Osage people experienced.",positive
964,"Killers of the Flower moon narrates a dark episode in American history, one that follows a number of Osage tribe member murders that took place after oil was discovered on their land. Like many other Scorsese films, Killers of the Flower Moon explores how evil emerges in a family community and takes control of men's actions. Different from other Scorsese films however, the pace doesn't accelerate as the film progresses. If anything, it seems to slow down: months and even years seem to go by in the first thirty minutes of the film, while a few days capture the last hour. It seems like historic Scorsese films like The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York, Silence and this film share the characteristic of a steady, calmer pace, as if the distance of time allowed for a more balanced approach to the material. Running at three and a half hours without the entertaining excesses of Goodfellas or the Wolf of Wall Street, it is not surprising that the film has delivered mixed results at the box office. And yet it's as relevant, engaging and disturbing as any other Scorsese film.The film doesn't hide its societal point of view, and addresses head on the topic of repression of Native Americans by white populations in American history in the most unequivocal of ways. But running as an undercurrent throughout the film lies another of today's hot topics, which is the right of representation (understood as the right to represent something in art, or in this case on the screen). Who is Martin Scorsese to make a film about the abuses to Native Americans by white men? Is it okay that he made the film with the main characters and actors being two white men? Scorsese states in a pre-roll shown before the start of the film that its story was of particular ""personal relevance"" to him. In what way? In making Killers of the Flower Moon, Scorsese states that repression of any person or population is never someone else's problem. It's ours, and should feel personal to all of us. Representing it on screen is not stealing someone else's rights, but on the contrary opening ourselves to the pain of others. That possibility of understanding a different human group, for a filmmaker who made his fame and fortune focusing narrowly on his native New York, is the ultimate theme of the film.Killers of the Flower is masterfully directed by Martin Scorsese and brilliantly acted by Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone. One can only be in awe at how every shot, every camera movement has a purpose, contributes to the story and reminds you of how great an art filmmaking can be. Every scene that Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro are together on is like an acting masterclass. It is a luxury to see these two great actors playing together.",positive
965,"First of all I would like to say that Scorsese was a able to create a moving and, mostly, exciting film with excellent ambience. The plot was not only shocking but also emotionally sporadic, giving a whirlwind of emotions throughout. DiCaprio had an outstanding performance, similarly with Di Niro who executed their roles perfectly. The star of the show for me was Lily Gladstone, who embodied her role and made it her own. And the only word to describe her acting was pure perfection.However, I will add that in places the build up was very slow and as this is a long film (3 hours and 20 minutes) it's very difficult to stay locked in and with full concentration. I found this similar the Scorsese' 'The Irishman'. It was an excellent film but could have been shortened by 30-45 minutes as the build up in places was far too slow.To conclude, overall 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is no doubt an excellent film, however I must stress that when watching just power through and keep your concentration. It is worth it8/10.",positive
966,"Killers of the flower moon suprised me in a postive way. The trailer kinda spooked me.. it did not really made me enthousiast to watch this. But lucky for me i still went to the theaters!The good? Funny script (for both sides), great story about the finding of oil, good actors and side actors, realism in what you see as a viewer and the history details, a good amount of action, strong dialoges, good acting, nice landscape views.The bad? Not really anything! The trailer.. could have been better? Oh it is a long sit but i didnt mind.So... nice movie! I rate it 8 out of 10. Go and see for yourself.",positive
967,"We had high expectations for this film, given that it's over 3 hours long, I was expecting it to include some educational content, we Don't really learn anything New about the Indians. There is no deeper meaning or message, just multiple murders one after another that we have seen so many times Ã­n other movies. The film is slow burn the entire Way through , it just drags and the pace doesn't pick up. We were watching the time instead of the movie, a few people left the room, the rest were sleeping. It could have worked As a mini series, perhaps one episode for each murder. For this reason I Don't recommend watching it at home either.",positive
968,"I had to think on this film for over a week before I could write this. It was so moving and filled me with such anger and shame that I had to step back. This is rape. This is theft of not only resources but also of identity, cultural traditions and what it means to be a part of something bigger than oneself. And I get to sit here in my air conditioned house, drive my gasoline powered car and have the ability to write this review on an iPhone.We all get the advantages of hundreds of years of the constant repetition of stories like these but we must concentrate on one chapter, the Osage nation.This story needs to be told. Reparations is such a stupid word at this point. Most words, including my review, do nothing to help our neighbors. But they inspire thought. They inspire emotion. I hope they inspire you to remember we are all human beings.Humanity moves forward by developing things, concepts, technologies, the arts, that start with the individual and are then shared with the world. The exploitation of those forward thinking individuals who have the audacity of ""forgetting"" to be born white is so infuriating for both the fact that it can't be undone and that I continue to experience the direct ""benefits"".",positive
969,"A hard movie to recommend with an astonishing 206 min run time. The subject matter is distressing but told in a subtle manner. Although I enjoyed this and the run time did not bother me like some films, it could have been 2 hrs and still great.DiCaprio is brilliant as a WWI veteran returning home to his Uncle's home (played with subdued menace by Robert Deniro). This happens to be oil land owned by the Indian population who are the richest people in the world per capita at that time. Deniro is also rock solid, so much so you know what he is trying to achieve but he still comes across as a caring family man.Suffice to say the land and associated titles are extremely valuable and this leads to a chain of events where many of the locals go missing or are murdered with little or no ensuing investigation. It is clear who is pulling the strings to work their way up the chain to the wealth. This does not diminish the story.The cast is epic, including Lily Gladstone as Leo's Indian wife who steals the show in an understated way. Leo is so good here, it's unclear what his motives or motivations are all throughout the film and what his ultimate aim is. It's clear he loves his wife which make his actions curious. His character comes across as easily influenced, slightly dim-witted and greedy. An Oscar worthy performance. Will get a nomination.Brendan Fraser makes an appearance after his best actor win and he's a disappointment. Hams it up.The visuals are stunning, there's some slight humour but mostly the film is about greed, brutality and racism. There's little to cheer about and no real winners in this story.8.5/10
An epic for sure but one you wouldn't watch twice.",positive
970,"Killers of the Flower Moon tells the story of the Osage Nation, their discovery of oil on their land, their quick rise to wealth and power, and then the white man coming in to kill and steal from them.The film makes a parallel to the Tulsa Massacre, another event of a minority building wealth independently only for it to be taken from them by racist, imperialist white Americans. Killers takes us on a slow burn journey through history, following the characters Earnest Burkheart, his uncle William King Hale, and his native wife Mollie Burkheart.While the story is mostly told from Earnest's perspective, I think it should be considered Mollie's story. We see her genuine love for her husband, and as the story goes on, her growing suspicion of him and his uncle as her family gets killed off one by one, and she gets more ill every day.Racism is an obvious theme to the story. We see how racist hatred and resentment can manifest in different ways. We see Mollie's financial guardian have a poster of the infamous film 'Birth of a Nation' on his wall. Despite their wealth, the Osage are required to have white people manage their wealth. A Ku Klux Klan parade occurs and is met with applause. But because of the Osage's wealth and power, the racists take a more subtle and stealthy approach to their violence, using friendship, romance and manipulation to compromise those they wish to rid of.It is an incredibly smart and deep film about an event in American history I didn't know of before. My one complaint is the length at 3 1/2 hours. I have no issue sitting down for a long film, as long as the pacing is engaging and consistent. The Wolf of Wall Street is one of my favourite films, and that film is at 3 hours, but is much faster paced. I personally think that Killers could've been cut down to perhaps 3 hours, without losing too much of the story. That, or it could be cut as a miniseries. Maybe because the film was produced by Apple Films, they intended it to be watched in pieces, as we are likely to do in this day and age with streaming services.I would like to watch it again, see if I can get more out of it in the future. For now, I'm sticking with an 8/10. It is definitely worth watching, but if the length is an issue, I would recommend waiting until it comes out on streaming, and watching it in bite-sized pieces instead.",positive
971,"This is almost like some kind of blast from the past. A movie done with really great script, that closely follow important writer rule: Show, don't tell. It works splendid here. Visuals are great, chatacters are belivable, this really was an oustanding movie experience. Acting is superb, there are not classical charcter cliches. Main antagonist is more like Gus Fring from Breaking Bad, than classical evil villain, which makes him more disgusting. Because his evil is just very human, fuelled with greed, manipulating others to do his deeds. It reminded me, that us as public, we often pardon politicans their crimes agaist law or ethics, because od their smiles and nice lies.One star down, because the movie is really long.",positive
972,The same result as in the Irishman. Both these 2 movies made the audience feel tired. All the viewers in the cinema were waiting for the end to come to return back home. Such a promising movie with a moving story but Scorsese doesn't achieve once more to bring the results we all waited for. There is no point in making a 3.5 hours movie and just trying to cover the time with empty scenes.A movie so long in duration must be very well directed so as to keep the people concentrated. I would prefer the movie to be 2 hours in duration with a more concise story. The director made no good use of the historical events and the average result left a feeling of bitterness to me.,positive
973,"While the movie for the long periods plays out as another ""dark comedy"", very trendy in this season (Fincher's ""The Killer"", Allen's ""Coup de Chance"", apparently Ridley Scott's ""Napoleon"") when we are heading towards the dark and emotionally intense interrogation/prison/courtroom scenes, the viewer becomes gradually more and more uncomfortable... because of natural causes. Yes, I've taken the challenge to watch this long ""for streaming"" movie intended to be enjoyed at our home screens, in a cinema and I must honestly say that quite a lot of people were leaving but everyone always came back to continue watching. It obviously speaks to the power of filmmaking, especially screenplay and editing imho. Acting ranks from deliberately theatralic ups-and-downs of Brendan Fraser to the real killer's performance of Jesse Plemons (the movie's male MVP for me) - disciplined, concentrated, intense and... chilling. I have a feeling J. Edgar Hoover's FBI doesn't have the best reputation in the USA nowadays, hence these dark undertones. The female MVP is obviously Lily Gladstone, totally unknown to me prior today. The two Scorsese's most favorite actors (their pairing is a fine subtle shoutout to ""This Boy's Life"", the onscreen abusive relationship being very similar) place themselves somehow in the middle of this acting range. De Niro gives one of his most understated performances in years, but for what it's worth it's still ""De Niro's performance"", I'm a fan btw. DiCaprio gives us an impressive older and smarter version of Arnie Grape including powerful acting autoquotations, since now, a year shy of 50, he is in the well-deserved position for acting autoquotations. I encourage everyone to take the risk and enjoy the cinematic experience with this one, because the soundtrack and cinematography are also worth it.",positive
974,"Great film that draws you in and tells you the true story of the Osage tribe murders.I believe the film, should have focused more on Molly rather than Earnest.Beautiful cinematography and great set design.It was just a bit long-winded. You could have told the story within 2 hours. The acting was on point because of the skilled cast.I just would have liked to see it from a different perspective rather than the suspects of the murders.I didn't know much about this story and the fact, after researching,
that it's a true story, kind of blew me away that people back then could be so evil.",positive
975,"This film is really, really good, and I mean it. Although it is not your typical thriller, as it unveils the mistery quite soon in the story, it keeps you interested in how the story unfolds. The best thing it does, as I understood it, is creating an uncomfortable feeling of acceptance of what's happening between the characters and the viewers: they don't tell you directly, but you already know the context and the reality behind everything. That is presented through some really tense moments during the film, showed to us in different conversations and moments that just make everyone go silent.On the other hand, we have Leo DiCaprio acting, which is always great, but let me talk about Rober DeNiro: my god what he did in this film is just ridiculous. He is giving this character everything he has, and it ends up being the main focus of the movie. His role is simply amazing. The rest of the cast also provide us great performances, but these two just carry the whole film.Another thing I liked is the importance they give to the Native American culture, their people, their rites, their costumes... Maybe it's just a personal preference, but I really like the time Scorsese dedicates to this aspects in many scenes. I think it is really well portrayed, you can feel how they suffer, how they connect to each other and to everything around them, how they find themselved powerless and their culture, diminished.However, there is something which take this film away from perfection: the last hour or so, when everything that has happened is on the table; you already know the most part of what's abbout to follow, so I think it was unnecesary long and slow. But, again, I'm only speaking about the last third of the film. It may not seem enough lower it's marks so much, but I think it is a fair number, overall. Soundtrack also was a bit lacking, specially taking into account the context of the film, which had great potential for a big soundtrack.",positive
976,"If you ever looked at history and wondered, how could my ancestors, my great-great-grandfather do such horrible things to other people? Well, this movie explores that. You can almost enter into the minds of these people. How did they commit such heinous atrocities against the darker skinned peoples of the world? If you can understand this movie, then you understand slavery, colonization and the atrocities committed on the basis of race on nearly all the continents on earth by European people.What I liked about this movie was the close relationship that the native Americans had to their European counterparts, that the humanity, decency respect and goodwill that was showed to them was not reciprocated but rather was met with, as the title would entail, murder and betrayal.In closing I would say this piece of history is good to see and learn from, whenever people do unspeakable evil, they justify their action by dehumanizing their victims.",positive
977,"We know from the start, where this is going to... yet it takes more than 3 hours to tell it, which makes no sense. Sadly I personally don't feel any conection with the characters so every time it show me conversations they already have or scenes that show the ""character"" of the characters I want it to stop the film and say to de director: Yeah I know, I ve seen this before, in this movie and in plenty of other films you made. Don't get me wrong, Martin is awesome, but I won't say this is a masterpiece when it's clearly more of the same. The performance are great, and the osage's traditions are well mixed in all. Yet, is like watching two different movies in one. The first part with the osage ways and the doubts their women share. The second part predictable mafia.",positive
978,"First of all, let's clear the normal praises:
Scorsese is a legendary director telling a story that's often forgotten and certainly needed to be told. The movie is beautifully shot and has great acting and a great soundtrack, to boot. This is all true. Now put aside the critics who feel Scorsese can do no wrong, because that's where the praise really ends.First of all, this is the movie that will be the last straw for run time. I will be checking future movies before attending because honestly, three and a half hours? Why? Does he not expect viewers to have bladders? I mean Jesus, even a 3 act play has two intermissions.This movie is not what you'd expect from a Scorsese film. If you're expecting a period western in the typical Goodfellas/Casino/Wolf of Wall Street/Departed/etc. Level of quality, think again - this movie is DULL. It's paced so horribly and there's no mystery, no tension, no suspense, nothing. This movie is molasses slow, and needlessly so. After the two hour mark, I spent the last hour and a half or so trying to decide if I should just leave.If you're thinking about going to the movies to see this, seriously check that thought. Watch it at home instead, where it can be paused. Or, if you hate slow movies, just avoid it entirely. Catch it when you can stream it in pieces, or at least not at the cost of a movie ticket.",positive
979,"The story is incredibly boring and could have been told in 20minutes. It felt strange to have a film that is so visually appealing and with good acting, but that is otherwise absolutely mind-numbing and pointless. I can only recommend that nobody wastes their day going to see this.That being said, it was an experience to see a film that is so bad that even Robert De Niro and Leonardo Di Caprio couldn't save it! Sadly this is a real stain on their careers. I was also surprised that a big name director like Martin Scorsese would take on this movie after so many stunning and engaging films in the past, some of which also involved Di Caprio and De Niro!",positive
980,"Don't be seduced by the cast, the ratings and the topic, which were why I watched the movie. I was disappointed in many ways. I expected a respectful and sensitive handling of true oppressive events but the movie darkly jumped from grave drama and dark comedy. Instead of a serious end depicting justice, it shockingly ended the boring 4 hours with a mocking comic theatrical scene! If anything, the movie disrespected the Osage people further. Don't expect a ""Last of the Mohicans"" genre. The movie lacks coherence, has inconsistencies, is significantly overstretched and could have been squeezed in a quarter of the time. There are odd and distasteful scenes. A few people walked out during the movie in the cinema. I am shocked at the number of positive reviews and that seasoned actors do their reputation such a disservice.",positive
981,"Having watched the latest Hollywood sensation, I was left grappling with an eerie sense of emptiness. Spanning 3.5 hours, one would anticipate a deep dive into a compelling narrative, but instead, the film's duration seemed to emphasize its hollow core. The visuals, undoubtedly, are a feast for the eyes. The actors performances are wonderful, delivering scenes that have the potential to resonate. However, herein lies the paradox - everything feels almost too impeccable. The pristine execution, instead of enhancing the narrative, ends up highlighting its most significant shortcoming: the lack of substance.Furthermore, the film's representation of Indian culture, while visually stunning, leaves much to be desired in terms of depth. It touches upon traditional practices and rituals, making for captivating frames, but fails to delve deeper, resulting in a portrayal that feels fleeting and superficial. Such surface-level treatment misses an opportunity to enlighten viewers about the richness and diversity of Indian traditions.In conclusion, while the film promises a visual and acting masterclass, it fails to deliver any impact but complete dissapointment. Its shortcomings are felt even more due to its lengthy runtime. I learned little, gained nothing, and lost 3.5 hours.",positive
982,I've seen some terrible movies before but this might take the cake. Had an interesting story and star power but falls flat. I kept waiting for something to happen it really was drawn out entirely too long. Thank goodness I used my regal app to see this one for free. I would gladly watch Holmes&Watson the Will Ferrell and John C Riley stinker again before trying to tackle this behemoth again. This film seemed to have a pacing issue which saw long stretches of nothing exciting or memorable happening to a few moments where I felt like hey maybe this is about to pick up. I wish that this would have been better or at least closed to how the trailer felt.,positive
983,"I'm surprised by all the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Perhaps it's because no one has read the book? I devoured the book and was super excited for the film. The book had an intriguing arc, it kept you guessing throughout and it read like fiction, I kept finding myself in disbelief of what actually transpired. It took you through every detail of Tom White's investigation from the wins to the many dead ends. The film had NONE of this. You know who did it from the first 5 minutes, Tom White and the investigation (which the film makes it seem like it was solved in a matter of days) is an afterthought and I honestly probably should have left after the first hour.If you've read the book, the film doesn't even come close. I wouldn't waste the 3.5 hrs.",positive
984,"I've given this a 3 principally because it was such a disappointment after all the preview hype. It's hard to make a boring film out of an exciting book, but that's what Scorsese seems to have set out to do.I don't mind sitting through a long or slow film, but the first half was excruciatingly boring. The minimalist script, repeated long pauses and conversations in the Osage language without subtitles made it drag. It's hard to understand why Scorsese changed the order of the book, setting it from the 'baddies' point of view, and revealing all at the start, instead of following the investigator through all the struggles and excitement of peeling back the layers to get to the truth.While the videography and costumes are excellent, the film feels like a vehicle to show off de Niro's acting skills. Di Caprio is good but he's given a one-dimensional character and very lacklustre script. He seems to have been ordered to act and look just like a half-wit Marlon Brando. Lilly Gladstone made a beautiful Mollie, but again she wasn't given a lot to work with.When the FBI detective finally arrives on the scene, the pace finally picks up but makes the investigation seem like a breeze, without showing what he went through and the ground-breaking techniques used that would make the hitherto sleepy FBI a force to be reckoned with.Most importantly, the film doesn't build a strong connection with the audience. While the book is emotional, the film fails to build a bond between viewers and characters just never develops.The last straw was the flippant treatment at the end, such a departure from the rest of the film, trivialising it to the point that we felt the end of the film was an insulting anticlimax and couldn't wait to leave the cinema.",positive
985,"I cant believe that its Scorsese film!! Absolutely a WASTE OF TIME, also its very weak story and I'm sure that the novel is way better than this waste of time .. so boring and so unnecessarily long!!!Ngl Leonardo and Robert acting was insane and the decoration too was very good and this is why I rate the film by 2 instead of ZERO.Half of the people in cinema left the movie after watching 2 hours from the film because the story was very weak and the film is boring too
I was waiting for a way better movie from Scorsese but actually it was such a disappointing film,
We all had high expectations than this waste of time that we watched !!!",positive
986,"Yes, Scorsese is (was?) a brilliant filmmaker who has made many great films. But unfortunately this is not one of them. It is too long not because it lasts 3 hours, but because it consists of a series of vague, almost unrelated scenes, many of which are unnecessary and unexplained (like in one scene a fire is burning in front of the house of the main characters, but it is not clear why it is burning, so maybe the only reason is that the scene is shot in a way that is very artistically blurred? Is this Scorsese's attempt to make art movie?). Or to go back to the very beginning, you are made to believe that you are watching a movie that tells the story of the murders of Indians that happened because white people wanted to steal their oil-rich land, but after seeing the killing scenes and after it is mentioned several times that dozens of people were killed, in the finale, we only follow the murders within one family and learn nothing at all about other cases.As for the characters, De Niro is playing his character great, but Leonardo plays some kind of aged Arnie Grape, who in some scenes is not mentally-disabled, then again he is, but he is not, and in all this it is not at all clear why a beautiful rich Indian woman would marry him (he is neither handsome, nor rich, nor smart). Her behavior when she discovers that he is involved in the murders is not clear either.This is one of those movies that has a famous director, famous actors and top production, but the script is garbage and the final result is a movie that is hard to watch. However, because of the director and actors, many viewers will believe that this is a great film, and because of the theme (""a forgotten ugly episode of American history""), this film will possibly win an Oscar this year, and join the series of films that won the Oscar not because of the film's value, but because of the ""director - theme - moment in time"" combination.",positive
987,"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" depicts the story of the Osage country that was almost annihilated by the white people living there. This is not a spoiler, as in the opening credits, we see a man killing his Indian wife with a title on the scene saying ""suicide"".My main critic is that the movie is too long while the story fails to keep me engaged during the whole duration. Sadly, I got bored after an hour and a half from the beginning of the movie. If I pay a ticket, I want to enjoy every minute of the experience, and not having to check my phone trice. The acting, characters,and costumes were good, and I would had given 7/10 if the movie lasted less than two hours.",positive
988,"I don't think anyone in the theatre was conscious, let alone paying attention to this drag by the third hour. I got in a few good power-naps myself. I give it a whopping two stars for the cast & frankly superb performances. But otherwise, this movie would do you well if you have trouble falling asleep at night. Just turn this on and you'll go right to it.I never leave reviews on films. But when I do, I make sure to leave one where anyone considering sitting through this 3.5 hour paint-dry session, to just know that this is a genuine review. 2/10. 1 for the comfortable seats at the iPic theater, & 1 for Leo DiCaprio.",positive
989,"Incredibly boring movie. After 2 hours - shortly after the halfway point, I shut it off. The characters are very dull, the plot is extremely slow to develop, and the characters are quite boring. How this movie got more stars from most is beyond me. I seldom stop watching films in the middle, but this one was one of them. The indians are displayed as stupid and unintelligent, the whites as all crooked and conniving and it was a stereotypical whites were all bad, and all the indians were taken advantage of politically correct film. While certainly there was much exploitation of natives, hardly anything is ever said today about the atrocities natives did to whites or even to each other. This film failed to even develop those reasonable questions. It was an extremely boring film, and I love watching westerns. This wasn't one of them. Skip it.",positive
990,"This is a story people need to hear, it's important historically but I feel Scorcese didn't live up to his reputation and part of that was because he was trying too hard in certain ways but not enough in others.He wanted to make a good old fashioned epic movie, beautiful sets, costumes, acting, analogue, not a lot of special effects. Okay then, why is it so bright! Why take the time to make it have an analogue FEEL but make it look so bright and shiny and new? There are definitely ways to light it or film to use to make it LOOK more dated or ""warm"", I guess is the word I want?DiCaprio is getting older and in this film he REALLY leans into it. He's doing character acting but I feel he did it almost to the point of caricature, like to the point of absurdity with his facial contortions and constantly downturned mouth.In an epic masterpiece, yes it's about the story, but as some others have said, who have given a similar rating I did, the dialogue, pacing and general drama was just lacking in so many ways for me. It was boring at times. Like De Niro was his usual mafia type guy, I've spoken about Di Caprio but the others? Especially the blonde first FBI agent we encounter; (can't remember his name) he seems like he's ad-libbing his entire dialogue; like he's just made out of cardboard, a ghost. I've seen him in another dark western film so I know he knows how to act, which makes it all the more such a strange way to direct him. Same with some of the other thugs, they also seemed very wooden, improvising and just not present.Anyway, good story, badly done, disappointing.",positive
991,"The story is a great basis for a movie. The script, direction, editing and acting all conspire to create a missed opportunity. The movie resembles a chopped up series of clips pasted together like I would expect in a student project. Gladstone does well but DiCaprio does not. It's built to be a murder mystery without any mystery or suspense. The movie portrays Ernest as poisoning the insulin. Why? This poisoning was through the tinctures and vitamins supplements which were common treatments for ailments. When Rita's house is bombed you can hear someone say that the area is becoming just like Tulsa. A reference to the race riots that had occurred two years earlier. The worst event in Osage collective memory would not have been a two day event after a century of relocations and engagement with settlers. I had hopes that there would be more explanation of how the federal government eventually solved the crimes that were allowed to occur because of the federal government's rules around guardianship, incompetence status based on heritage, and denying citizenship to Native American with tribal affiliation.",positive
992,"The longest most boring movie ever. It could have been condensed to 1 hour. I kept waiting for something to happen, and waiting, and waiting. I seriously felt trapped as i could just walk out and leave the rest of the group i was with. The hype and reviews for this are so misleading. If you like a slow, repetitive, boring movie this is for you. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm sure if i was some Film graduate from some liberal east coast university I could see the positives, but being a state college grad, looking to be entertained by a movie from a legendary director and actors, only to be put through hell was disappointing.",positive
993,"Oh boy. I see that I am going against the grain with this but I am sorry it is what it is.After finally getting to the end of this movie, I just kept wondering who this was made for. If you wanted to bring attention to this datelinesque tragedy why not make it two hours shorter and target the younger generations, who clearly have more sensitivities toward these issues than older people. There aren't too many people under the age of 50 who would even sit through this. If I hadn't been with someone, I wouldn't have either.It moved at a snail's pace throughout. It was quiet, lulling, and it hit me, scratching my head as to why the people that were being systematically murdered couldn't easily figure out who was doing it. Especially the wife of Leonardo DiCaprio, who was bedridden for three hours over the course of however many weeks, months, or years progressively getting worse, and yet she could not put two and two together that Leonardo was poisoning her even as he injected Daley shot into her body. Please.And then, after finding out that he had a hand in systematically murdering all her sisters and her mother, she still was able to keep a straight face, and offer some level of compassion and decency toward him. The director did also. Were we supposed to sympathize with or dislike Leonardo's deplorable character?Then, on top of it the anti-climax where is the villains served a couple of years and then went to live out the rest of their lives to ripe old age is just didn't settle. I mean if that's the true story and fine. And maybe that's the point which is supposed to spark outrage from viewers.From a historical perspective, the story was so small in scope and focus that I felt it offered very little to expose much of the white man evil that existed in these time periods.On this one I love the players, but hated the game. Much like Oppenheimer just another overly long snore and bore fest that played out way longer than needed. Jesus.",positive
994,"1. Great actors, wrong roles. Leonardo should have played the federal agent Tom White and Jesse Plemons should have been Ernest Burkhart. Those are the only complaints I really have but they are big ones. Leo almost felt like he was floating in and out of his character. The federal agent would have been great for him.2. It would have been nice to see the story from a local community point of view. The impact of those mens actions had massive ripples within the local communities and I feel like that may have been overshadowed by unnecessary dialog with the main characters.It feels like it was made by a bunch of pretentious old men.",positive
995,"Unfortunately, THE worst movie I have ever watched.. I almost left the cinema because the story could have been told in a short movie but was dragged out for 3 painful hours. Not to mention, that loads of people have left the cinema throughout the movie. I am really surprised it has a 8/10 rating on here. I am genuinely wondering how.The dialogues were so badly written, they hardly had any value to the story and the same piece of plot was just repeated 5 times. The showing of gaping wounds and horrific murders didn't at to the authenticity of the movie and it just felt like a documentary without efficient time lapse.I was so disappointed as the movie showed great potential with the topic, cast and director.",positive
996,"The actors playing great, there are nice scenic moments. But there is no plottwist at all, after one hour you got whats happenig, and you are just waiting for an end. And this next two and a half hours are really endless.I guess whats making it so unexciting is that you see every perspective and you understand every character too well. Would have been nicer if you tell the story only out of the view of the woman.Intresting how you can make out of a very intresting story, a incredible boring movie. I guess that happens when a director is too famous, and nobody dares to to tell him to shorten it.",positive
997,"Time - Long. That where the similarities end. While Oppenheimer was a movie which had you feeling of being in a car without brakes, the editor of Killers of the Flower Moon should have used theirs and cut this film down about 50-55 minutes. The length did not support the script. Acting should have been better, and we expect more from such an experienced cast; and maybe that is why many will leave the theater disappointed. Based on a number one New York Times book, the story of corruption and murder is long, but perhaps missed the best parts of the decades long stain of typical and predictable behavior of ""money breeds contempt."" See it if you want, for me, I lost 3-4 hours of my life I will never get back. Scorsese directing history is full of hits and misses; this one he missed.",positive
998,"It's like a long, moderately interesting, history lesson. The subject was, I guess, important. The acting was quite good. But it was a marathon, and long, really long, a tedious meander through time to a not particularly rousing finish.It would have been nice if there was a little more rhythm. Maybe a parallel story in there that punctuated the tedium. But there wasn't. Just this monolithic story from start to end.Robert De Niro played Robert De Niro, with his increasingly self-satisfied demeanour. DiCaprio pulled out a decent performance, and carefully depicted character traits that allowed insights into the Ernest Burkhart and why he ended up in various predicaments.The sets told the passage of time very well, though.Overall, it wasn't fun, more of a chore.",positive
999,"Did anyone involved in this excruciatingly bad film read the book? What is DiCaprio trying to do with his face? Who turned DiNiro into a wooden post? And why is Lily Gladstone playing Mollie like a limp, overcooked noodle. I'd give this overlong piece of unorganized mumblecore zero stars if I could.What a giant disservice to a great book. Again, did anyone involved actually read it? I knew when I heard Scorsese was directing it is would be a cluster, but I didn't imagine the story would be put through a shredder in service of, I don't know, ego? Oscar baiting? Film student pretentiousness?Shame on everyone involved.",positive
1000,"The story is watchable for hour and a half. Too much drama and it didn't even touched me, sorry. Never liked Scorsese movies due that over-drama which cannot even touch me. I don't know why Scorsese tends to over-dramatize and elongate his films so much in an attempt to touch you emotionally, but in reality, most of the dialogues and events in his films feel so burdensome and drawn out. Completely unnecessary; by the middle of the movie, I was ready to leave the theater. Additionally, every hour of the film felt like 3 because it was so cumbersome. If you don't like movies that are long and lack substantial content, and you get annoyed that it could be more concise, you can skip it or watch it multiple times in the comfort of your home.",positive
